We have 2 modes of thinking: focused and diffuse

[[Focused mode]] - Intently concentrating to learn or to understand

[[Diffuse mode]] - Relaxed style of thinking. Big-picture perspective. Creates new neural pathways that link ideas.
- You can't be in both focused and diffuse modes at the same time.

To effectively learn something new or difficult, your mind needs to go back and forth between these 2 modes.

To enter diffuse mode, do an activity that relaxes your conscious mind like showering or going for a run
- If the pain areas in your brain are activated by an unpleasant task (such as writing a report or doing dishes), your brain tries to stop this negative stimulation by switching your attention to something else.

This is what [[procrastination]] is.
- To overcome [[procrastination]], just start doing the task. The "neuro-discomfort" will soon decrease.

It's easier if you set a time limit, like 25 minutes. Most anyone can manage working for a pomodoro session.

Then after you're done, give yourself a little reward.
- ✗　"Practice makes perfect"

✓　"Practice makes permanent"

The neural structures in your brain are strengthened through practice.

You don't want to practice the wrong way over and over again.

Understanding comes by practicing the concepts and ideas, not by rote memorization.
- 2 types of memory:
- [[Working memory]]
- [[Long term memory]]

Working memory is the immediate, conscious processing in the prefrontal cortex. It holds about 4 chunks of information

Long term memory is a storehouse. It takes practice to retrieve information stored here to access easily
- [[Spaced repetition]] is one of the best and most efficient ways to move information from [[Working memory]] into easily-retrievable [[Long term memory]].

This works by recalling the information at ever-increasing intervals.
- For example: If you learn something today, test yourself on it tomorrow. If you get it right, test yourself again 2 days later. Then 4 days later after that. And so on.

[[Anki]] is an app that does this spacing automatically with digital flashcards https://apps.ankiweb.net
- Brain cells build up toxins during the day. In sleep, the cells shrink to allow space for fluid to wash them away.

If you don't get enough [[sleep]], these toxins remain and can interfere with your thinking during the day.

That's another reason not to stay up all night cramming.
    - 
- [[Sleep]] lets your brain sort through what you've been learning, culling unimportant ideas, and strengthening the important ones, even rehearsing the difficult ones (through dreams).

Your brain structure changes, and you are not the same person after a night's sleep, or even a nap.
- When we procrastinate, there's a neural discomfort that keeps us from wanting to do a task. After pushing through that discomfort, it becomes easier to continue the task.

The Pomodoro technique is an effective way to overcome this initial discomfort.
    - This reminds me of physics: it requires more force to put a stationary object into motion against static friction, than the force required to keep that object in motion against kinetic friction.
