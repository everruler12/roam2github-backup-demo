We have 2 modes of thinking: focused and diffuse

[[Focused mode]] - Intently concentrating to learn or to understand

[[Diffuse mode]] - Relaxed style of thinking. Big-picture perspective. Creates new neural pathways that link ideas."
    - "You can't be in both focused and diffuse modes at the same time.

To effectively learn something new or difficult, your mind needs to go back and forth between these 2 modes.

To enter diffuse mode, do an activity that relaxes your conscious mind like showering or going for a run"
