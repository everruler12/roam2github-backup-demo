    - ðŸŽ¥ [@cahouser]([[Cam Houser]]) put on another great video workshop with the Crossfit for Writing crew!

I was able to write an outline, record a 3-4min video, screen it to the group, receive feedback, then record a better version. From start to finish it only took 2 hours.

    - Honesty and telling the truth... Good.

Opinions are not truths. You should tell the truth when possible, but don't be so arrogant to think that you actually know the truth. We are all quite ignorant, and are susceptible to biases that hinder our vision of what's true.
