    - It'd be nice if facts, stats, and education changed people's minds. But it doesn't seem that's how the brain works.

I've had major belief changes in regards to religion and diet. I'd like to think it was for rational reasons based on my personal research and critical thinking.
    - But ultimately, there's always an emotional reason behind any belief change.
