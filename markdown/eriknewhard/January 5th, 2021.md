    - Epiphany about what it means to love myself...

Since reading Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It three months ago, I've been doing the daily affirmations and mirror exercises.

"I love myself."

However, I've only been talking to my present self...
    - Above the dish sink, my family has a digital photo frame with a repeating slideshow of memories spanning past my childhood.

Whenever I glimpse an image of me from high school and early college days, I look away in disgust...
    - That was the "dark" era in my life, when I was an antisocial loser, overweight with a slouched posture, addicted to pizza and sugar, video games, movies, TV shows, anime, and porn.

I've been hating my past self...
    - It was repugnance with my situation that eventually propelled me into the world of personal development. I started researching diets and eating healthy. I went running outside in the steamy Florida summer. I began reading non-fiction, self-help books, and listening to podcasts...
    - I've changed a lot. However, love has not been the root motivator behind that change and my desire to improve.

There's a difference between losing weight because I'm disgusted with myself and hate how I look, versus because I love myself and want the best health for my body...
    - Loving myself means accepting my past self, unconditionally. I wouldn't be here today without that past Erik. I was coping the best I knew how at that time. And back then, when I researched how to become better, I gradually did. I'm still improving. I'm still the same Erik.
    - It's hard to say, but it will get easier: I love and accept my past self.
