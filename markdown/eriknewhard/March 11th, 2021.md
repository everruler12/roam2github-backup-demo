Here are 3 non-diet ways that have transformed my toilet routine into a more pleasant pooping experience in the past year...
    - 1. Squatting on a stool

This puts you in a more natural posture for easier elimination.

    - 2. Using essential oil spray

This traps stinky smells on the surface of the water, leaving only fragrant scents in the air.

    - 3. Washing with water

Due to the "Great Toilet Paper Shortage of 2020", I did some researching for alternatives. This article convinced me to get a bidet bottle. It's way faster and cleaner than toilet paper. Never going back.
