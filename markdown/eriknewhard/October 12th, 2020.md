    - Questions aren’t a sign of ignorance; they’re a sign you’re paying attention.

If you don’t know what’s going on, there’s no shame in asking questions.

Killing conversations because either you or the other person "isn't technical" is a bad practice that won't help anyone.
    - If you're explaining something technical, use the Feynman technique. Use metaphors so even a child can grasp the concept.

If you're in a conversation over your head, try your best to keep up, and ask questions as needed. Don't kill the other person's enthusiasm by giving up.
    - "Technical people are just people who try to understand."
