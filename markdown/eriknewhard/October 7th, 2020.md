    - I'm excited for [@RobbieCrab]([[Robbie Crabtree]])'s Performative Speaking course!

Today I had an onboarding call with [@SeenConnors]([[Sean Connors]]) and chatted with [@KyleBowe]([[Kyle Bowe]])

I've hated speaking even more than writing. If this can do what Write of Passage did for my writing, I'll be speechless. Wait no, speechful!
