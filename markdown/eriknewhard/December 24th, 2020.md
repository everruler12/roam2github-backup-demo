    - The entire purpose of ads is to manipulate you into buying something, usually by invoking a feeling of discontentment, inadequacy, or greed. Even if you think you're not affected, they still penetrate your subconscious and influence your thinking.
    - For example, if an ad has an attractive person using the product, whether you buy the product or not, you're being sold on social standards of human beauty, which your mind will make comparisons with.

Blocking internet ads are one way to protect your psychological health.
    - On desktop computers, I recommend installing the [[uBlock Origin]] browser extension.

When I help people with their computers, that's one of the first things I do, and they are greatly appreciative of it.

[[Brave Browser]] is also good, with a built-in [[ad blocker]].
