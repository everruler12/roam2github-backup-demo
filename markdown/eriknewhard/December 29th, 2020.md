    - How to "strive for progress, not perfection"?
By focusing on the process, not the product.

When I made a goal last week of publishing 100 videos, one every weekday, my focus was on the end product. A better way to make and measure progress is to follow a system.
    - "For the next '12-week year', work on producing a video for at least two pomodoro sessions between 9-11am."

This way, even if I don't publish a video, I can still see progress. Before, if I didn't finish a video, the whole day felt like a failure.
    - Plan a good system.
Trust the process and follow through.
(Tweak the system when necessary.)
And the products will naturally result.
