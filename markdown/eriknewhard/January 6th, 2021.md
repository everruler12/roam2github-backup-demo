    - My Notes - Tweet Thread of Threads

In an effort to learn in public, and to practice formulating concepts in my own words, I'll be starting a tweet thread for each new book I read. As I read, I'll tweet my thoughts based on the chapter and highlights.
        - tweet thread? tweet storm?
        - not just books, bus also courses
            - not podcasts, because each thread should have a theme
        - DON"T MAKE THIS THE START OF THE THREAD. START THE THREAD AFTER FINISHING THE FIRST BOOK. JUST SET MY INTENT
