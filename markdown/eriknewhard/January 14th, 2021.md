    - "Advice is a form of nostalgia"

People, especially friends and family, mean well when they give you advice, but that doesn't mean their advice is good for you.

A lot of advice is only a hypothesis based on personal experiences about how they think things could have gone better.
    - The most valuable advice comes from those who have experimented and experienced the results.

The best advice I've heard is: pay attention to the advice of those who have already achieved the kind of life you want to live.
    - Example:

If you want a happy, long-lasting marriage, listen to those in happy, long-lasting marriages.

Someone who's divorced can point to one of many paths that leads to failure. Useful. But they are not in a position to guide you down the path that leads to your success.
