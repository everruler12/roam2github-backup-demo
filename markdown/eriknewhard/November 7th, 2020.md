    - "[[Spaced repetition]] is one of the best and most efficient ways to move information from [[Working memory]] into easily-retrievable [[Long term memory]].

This works by recalling the information at ever-increasing intervals."
    - "For example: If you learn something today, test yourself on it tomorrow. If you get it right, test yourself again 2 days later. Then 4 days later after that. And so on.

[[Anki]] is an app that does this spacing automatically with digital flashcards https://apps.ankiweb.net"
