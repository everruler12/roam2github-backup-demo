One of the most common questions we are asked is how to export notes from Roam. Here is a short guide on how you can export any page from your Roam graph!
First navigate to the page you want to export and then press **Export** inside the **... Share menu **in the top right of your screen:

Next you can choose between Markdown and JSON formats for the page you want to export. We recommend exporting into JSON if you want to import the page into another Roam graph as it keeps more Roam-specific information than Markdown allows for.
