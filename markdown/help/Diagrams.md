- If you're just getting started with Roam, make sure to check out [[Welcome to Roam]] and [[Roam for Zettlekasting]] first
- For people who want to try out the more #Experimental Features though, here are diagrams (still definitely a work in progress)
    - To create a diagram just write :diagram at the beginning of a block
        - [[Example]]
            - :diagram
                - {{table}}
                    - Pros
                        - Cons
                    - it's cool
                        - it's confusing

                - Relates to these ideas
                - 
                - 
    - Every node that you create in the diagram will be made into a bullet nested below that diagram
        - hint -- it works way better in fullscreen
        - You can still do all the same things in these nodes that you can anywhere else in Roam
            - So you can try out the experimental features like the [[Tables]] view
            - or use markdown
    - Instructions
        - To create a node -- double click on the background -- or just add a bullet beneath the canvas
        - To draw lines
            - hold the alt key and draw between nodes
    - To draw containers
        - hold key and draw the shape
    - To select multiple elements
        - hold the shift key and draw out a rectangle
