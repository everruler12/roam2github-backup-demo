In order for the pomodoro bell sound to go off, the timer needs to be in a page that's currently **open** in your graph.
Here's an example:
    - I start a pomodoro timer, and the block is on my [[Daily Notes]] page for the day.
    - While working I open other pages
    - If at the end of the pomodoro session I haven't returned to my [[Daily Notes]] view, **I won't hear the sound**
The solution is fairly simple:
    - Once you decide the page where you want your pomodoro timer to live, open that same page in the [right sidebar]([[Right Sidebar]]), so that your timer will always stay in an open page.
