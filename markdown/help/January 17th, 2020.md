    - [[Zettelkasten]] party
        - materials:: A few hundred index cards
        - steps::
            1. Host generates a prompt
                - Could be a few questions or topics, could be things like:
                    - 20 things you think are interesting and plausibly true about X
            2. Each participant has a letter or simple symbol to represent them - put it on a whiteboard so you know who is who
            3. Participants gather around a large table
                - Floor is ok too if no access to tables
            4. Each participant generates 10-20 "hot takes" which they write on index cards (give a time limit for this - maybe 10 minutes - can encourage people to come with ideas already written out if you want) 
                - Each card has a unique ID of the player's symbol and the number card it is
                - Cards can reference other cards the player has written in their text by ID
                    - example::
                        - C1: New ideas are formed by connecting old ideas
                        - C2: Because of {{alias: ((msPqrA8_Z)) C1}} Roam research is great for having new ideas
                - #[[Optional]] they can put their certainty on the back of the card on a scale like this
                    - {{[[slider]]}}
                        - where instead of their image, you put their character or symbol
            5. After the first round, each player rotates once, and has a few minutes to respond to other cards -- new cards have an ID of -- Card it is responding to - user - then number of response
                - Example::
                    - C1/J1:  Josh's first response to Conor's First Card
            6. Optional
                - have a whole punch or tape, and a collection of string -- connect the cards that reference one another, so that when you pull on the string you can collect a thread of related cards, and to give a high level idea of structure of the graph of ideas.
                - If pursuing "#[[Optional]] they can put their certainty on the back of the card on a scale like this" -- other user's also put their certainty, and create response cards with their reasoning/evidence/counter-evidence/conditional probability etc.
            7. Modify the rules for fun and profit
