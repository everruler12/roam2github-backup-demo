- Many people don't realize that you can link directly to every bulletpoint in Roam 
    - And 
        - that these [Block refs]([[Block References]]) are also [Bidirectional]([[Bidirectional Links]])
        - That you can wrap a reference to a page or block in a markdown link to provide it with an alias.

    - Want to do some quick comparisons between [[It's Time To Build]] and the [[Roam White Paper]]
        - Goals::
            - One of the underlying motivations for [[Roam]] is to build a more [[Anti-Fragile]] or at least [[Resilient]] [[Civilization]], and I suspect there are differences of opinion between myself and [[Marc Andreesen]] on the what the underlying cause is to the current failures of our institutions and what the path is to build better institutions
                - I suspect we're pretty closely aligned though
                - I want to get more articulate about what I think the problems are, and work a bit off his thinking and past writing I did with [[Richard Meadows]] to do so
            - Provide a demo video showing how I use Roam to approach a thinking problem
                - a problem of exploring past writing, and current writing to come to a more articulate position / have new ideas.

        - [[Roam White Paper]]
            - "Large-scale collaboration requires a more flexible data structure than the classic file tree. Roam is built on a knowledge graph that maps all possible relationships, with ‘smart’ links between defined concepts. Users can connect similar ideas in multiple overlapping hierarchies, remix them without overwriting the original context, and selectively share parts of the graph with others to collaborate on specific sub-questions."
                - Large scale collaboration on complex problems really isn't possible today.
                    - see [[Reinventing Discovery]]
                        - we don't have [[Kasparov vs The World]] infrastructure for getting a large group of experts to be able to effectively allocate their attention on a complex issue
                            - Instead we have a sort of command and control - decentralized but not distributed system
            - "For power users, the knowledge graph also unlocks applications in logic and reasoning, Bayesian inference and decision-making, modelling complex problems, and collaborative research."
            - "Everything from peer-reviewed research papers to the opinion pages of a newspaper are based on formulating arguments that support a certain premise, along the lines of the following: "
                - "If A is true, then B is true."
                - "If C and D are both true, then A is true."
                - "C and D are true."
                - "Therefore, B is true."
            - "Often, C and D will be supported by links to external articles, where they are conclusions reached by larger arguments based on combining other premises. Unfortunately, the structure of the argument is only implied by the prose. Rarely are the relationships between arguments and pieces of evidence explicitly laid out, except perhaps in the notes of the author investigating the claims."
                - The Media in particular failed to prepare people for the pandemic -- see [[ReCode]] vs [[Balaji Srivasanan]]

                                - At least in some effective institutions - definitely -- the existence of my twitter community completely changed my behavior in preparation for the pandemic -- we started sheltering in place in February, buying material, getting things needed just for Worst Case Scenarios, figuring out Work from Home scenarios [!]([[Claim]])
