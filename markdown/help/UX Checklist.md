    - Two components
        - Problem definition
            - [[User Goals]]
                - + [[User Fears]]
            - [[Violated Expectations]] + [[Necessary Communication]]
                - are there things we need to communicate (like fact that emails don't send on adding another user)
        - Option consideration
            - List of options - each is tested to see if it meets the user goals
                - include screenshots and links to figma files
                - for each option -- say whether it meets the criteria
            - Best option
