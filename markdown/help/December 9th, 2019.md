        - [[The Independent Researcher]]
            - "Many researchers were personally wealthy or had access to deep pockets. ^^Charles Darwin pursued scientific collection as a hobby, and his first voyage on [HMS Beagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Survey_voyage_on_HMS_Beagle) was funded by his family^^. James Prescott Joule, after whom the joule is named, was “scientifically self-taught”, [doing research in his off-hours at the family brewery](https://books.google.com/books?id=i0XbtpXmcUsC&lpg=PA144&ots=bf4yeXsp0f&d&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q&f=false). And in the 1930s, Alfred Lee Loomis used his Wall Street wealth to start a laboratory [in his mansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Lee_Loomis#Laboratory_at_Tuxedo_Park), nicknamed “The Palace of Science”, where physicists like Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Enrico Fermi collaborated."

        - [[Technical Conversations]]
            - These quotes vvv
                - "Sometimes, when listening to a technical conversation, I think about my grandmother immersed in gibberish, waiting for a few, precious words to reveal themselves to her. Saying ^^__“I’m not technical”__, while a well-intentioned reflex, prematurely shuts down the upper bound of the conversation.^^ Worse, it signals __“I’m not that kind of person so don’t try to talk to me like I am”__, which can have a dampening effect on the other person, especially if they’re genuinely excited to share something they care about. It’s the conversational equivalent of putting your hands up."
                - "If you don’t know what’s going on, there’s no shame in asking questions. ^^Questions aren’t a sign of ignorance; they’re a sign you’re paying attention.^^ “Technical” people is kind of a nonsensical term, when you think about it. Nobody is literate on every technical topic out there. A chemist has no idea what a cryptographer is talking about (unless they’ve learned both fields, of course!). ^^**I think technical people are just people who try to understand.**^^"

                    - [[Technical People are just people who try to understand]]
                    - [[Questions are a sign you're paying attention]]
            - "It’s okay to not know what people are talking about. It’s okay if it feels like complete gibberish for awhile, and it’s okay to admit that you only understood 5% of the conversation thus far. If you only understood 5% this time, well, maybe next time it’ll be 10%. [[Your brain is wired to find patterns in chaos]]. ^^Eventually, the words will decipher themselves.^^"
                - relates to twitter thread on [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam for Zettlekasting]]
