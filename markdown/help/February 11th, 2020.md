- [[Kanban Experiment]]
    - Round 1
        - Core Idea::  Have a query for your todos next to the kanban board, then drag items from their original location into the board
        - {{kanban}}
            - Backlog
                - This item
            - DOING
            - DONE
        - Results::
            - Currently we aren't parsing the blocks in kanban -- need to do that for this to be useful.
            - also - would be good for tags + filters to respect info added to a block via its references.
        - {{query: {and: [[TODO]]}}}}
    - Round 2
        - ## Automated Kanban
            - {{table}}

                        - **DONE** {{[[query]]: {and: [[DONE]] [[kb]] {not: [[query]]}}}}
