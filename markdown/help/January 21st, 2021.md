    - [[Claim]] Notifications can be extremely disruptive to deep work
        - However::
            - when you're working with other people in a shared Roam graph, you do want to know when someone has referenced something in another location and you have not yet read it.
                - Therefore::
                    - We want some way to signal that there are unread blocks from other users which reference a block that you have not yet seen.
                - Furthermore::
                    - When we return to something we wrote or looked at a long time ago, we want to see if there have been any new places the ideas have been referenced by others
    - Given:: that "[[Claim]] Notifications can be extremely disruptive to deep work" and "We want some way to signal that there are unread blocks from other users which reference a block that you have not yet seen." and "When we return to something we wrote or looked at a long time ago, we want to see if there have been any new places the ideas have been referenced by others"
        - We have added this functionality to Roam
