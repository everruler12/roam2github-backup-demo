- What is this section
    - What are the ideas that have most changed the way you view and interact with the world? What is the best resource you have ever found for explaining that idea?
    - This section is a new section where some members of the [[Junto]] have chosen to share a selection of some of the most powerful ideas or pieces of content they have come across in their life.
- [[Conor White-Sullivan]] - written circa [[June 1st, 2016]]
    - People::
        - [[Doug Engelbart]]
            - See his original 1962 paper [[Augmenting the Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework]]
        - [[Brett Victor]]
            - Bio::
                - Used to be a big R&D guy for apple, now runs his own R&D lab, all of the things he builds are designed to demonstate a powerful idea, and hopefully influence what the maker community makes. One of my favorite thinkers, and an archetypal activist-inventor.  Small details in the presentation of his papers make his work even more delightful. For instance, he makes it possible to hyperlink to specific paragraphs in MagicInk, or 'skim' a long talk in Media for Thinking the Unthinkable. He does in his presentation of ideas all the things I wished we could have done at HuffPostLabs.
            - Core Ideas::
                - 1) Inventors can and should be driven by a core theme for how to improve the world just as activists are
                - 2) The progress of mankind is built upon the progress of the our ability to externally represent and manipulate thoughts (ie before the arabic placeholder numeral system, only elite roman mathematicians could multiply)
                - 3) The way we present information online is usually awful. It does not need to be.
                    - Paper:: [[Magic Ink]] http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/
                        - This is the resource I most highly recommend to anyone designing anything on the web today, it is especially important for UI designers working in the journalism field. The fact that it is from 2006 and still cutting edge is a little mind blowing and a little depressing.
                        - In his words:
                            - Although this paper presents a number of concrete design and engineering ideas, the larger intent is to introduce a “unified theory” of information software design, and provide inspiration and direction for progressive designers who suspect that the world of software isn’t as flat as they’ve been told.
                        - Most useful for people who work on the internet, academia or in media, but also for a general audience of anyone who has to present information. I recommend highly.
                - 4) The way we write code sucks, because computer scientists/engineers/hackers don't look at history (of the field, particularly stuff done in the 70s-90s), don't challenge assumptions, and like having/being a priesthood. This is holding humanity back.
                    - Paper::  http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/
                    - Talk:: The Future of Programming (he presents in 2012, pretending to be a guy in 1970, showing that the worst fears have come true, and best hopes have not been realized. Progress is not inevitable) https://vimeo.com/71278954
        - [[Yochai Benkler]]
            - Bio::
                - Used to be at Yale, now runs Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law. Called as the expert witness by the defense in Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning. Probably the academic that is most widely known and read by internet people. Probably the closest thing I have to a Karl Marx. Looking through his latest papers I realize there is a lot he has written about that I haven't read and should. He writes a ton about the Public Sphere, Broadband, Connectivity, Democracy, IP, Copyright.  Plenty to disagree with, but he's a great place to start.
            - Papers:: Full set of papers here: http://benkler.org/Pub.html
            - Core Ideas::
                - 1) Commons Based Peer Production is a BIG FUCKING DEAL. Like, potentially big as the introduction of markets or nation-state. He wasn't being coy or arrogant when he called his book The Wealth of Networks.
                    - Components of this idea:::
                        - marginal vs non-marginal goods (me having an apple prevents you from having the same apple, me having a digital picture of an apple does not prevent you)
                        - power at the edges
                        - separating management from ownership
                        - Who owns the "means of production" for information knowledge and culture
                        - Social or Peer Production at Scale
                        - Coordination Costs and Management of Collective Action
                        - The Commons and the Anti-Commons
                    - Talk:: http://www.ted.com/talks/yochai_benkler_on_the_new_open_source_economics?language=en
                        - This is possibly the talk that most changed my life
                    - Papers::
                        - Peer Production and Cooperation, forthcoming in J. M. Bauer & M. Latzer (eds.), Handbook on the Economics of the Internet, Cheltenham and Northampton, Edward Elgar.

                        - Networks of Power: Degrees of Freedom

                        - Between Spanish Huertas and the Open Road: A Tale of Two Commons
                - 2) Sharing Economy:  There are certain goods which it does not actually make economic sense to own, but also it did not make sense to administer access to via a company or the state, this is where the internet enabled sharing economy will (and now has) create(d) a ton of value.
                    - Papers:: Sharing Nicely http://benkler.org/SharingNicely.html
                        - This paper basically predicted Uber, Lyft, and AirBnB, like 7 years before any of them launched.
                    - Quotes::
                        - The paper offers a framework to explain large scale effective practices of sharing private, excludable goods.  It starts with case studies of distributed computing and carpooling as motivating problems.  It then suggests a definition for “shareable goods” as goods that are lumpy and mid-grained in size, and explains why goods with these characteristics will have systematic overcapacity relative to the requirements of their owners.  The paper then uses comparative transaction costs analysis, focused on information characteristics in particular, combined with an analysis of diversity of motivations, to suggest when social sharing will be better than secondary markets to reallocate this overcapacity to non-owners who require the functionality.  The paper concludes with broader observations about the role of sharing as a modality of economic production as compared to markets and hierarchies (whether states or firms), with a particular emphasis on sharing practices among individuals who are strangers or weakly related, its relationship to technological change, and some implications for contemporary policy choices regarding wireless regulation, intellectual property, and communications network design.
        - Paul Graham
            - Bio::
                - Founder of YC, I've read every one of his essays. He is seriously fucking onto something, also fact that he has now, via YC helped create 3 $Billion+ companies doesn't hurt as proof point
            - Core Ideas:: (selection of my favorite essays)

        - Tim Ferriss
            - Bio:: (why he matters to me)
                - Do less, accomplish more
                - Some solid original ideas, but at the core, if I only could have one source for new content to pay attention to it'd probably be TFerriss, mostly because he also shares an appreciation of minimalism, contrarianism (especially when it comes to thinking about what we want out of life), and constantly seeking the most effective ways to learn things.
                - He also happens to be prolific, and writes/produces/curates for a rabid and massive fan base of people who are crazy into efficiency and challenging assumptions about what is even worth making efficient or doing at all.
            - Key Ideas::
                - [[Pareto Principle]]
                    - Also called the 80/20 Rule, find the areas where inputs produce maximum outputs and focus on those. Tim is very good about that when it comes to fitness, finances, and learning in general.

    - Concepts::
        - Engelbart's law
        - Psych/Growth Mindset
        - Mindful Learning #mostinfluential #mostuseful
    - Dominant Themes::
        - One really central thing missing from those links is the idea that you cannot change a deep seated belief through argument, that you create experiences where people come to those conclusions themselves. The other is the connection of these ideas to freedom, justice, truth, and the future.
        - One of the things that got me on this route was reading [[The Long Haul]] by [[Myles Horton]], which is his telling of the behind the scenes stuff he was doing during the civil rights and workers rights movements last century.  Horton on the surface looks like the furthest thing from a tech philosopher, but his bottom up, experiential, peer-to-peer style of educating (and how effective it was in training leaders during those big movements) struck me as totally an embodiment of the same sort of "libertarian-socialism" that I was starting to think about through Benkler.
        - The combination of those two, [Benkler]([[Yochai Benkler]]), Horton, but to be honest, also [[Clay Shirky]] (though his riff on coordination costs lead to what I think was a failed thesis in my last company), were what set me off on this track that an open source social movement is possible and necessary to building the best possible future.  On a personal note, I probably wouldn't have been so pumped about that idea if I wasn't alreay hard core anti-imperialist and anti-authoritarian due to my mom telling me stories about the British occupation and exploitation of Ireland every night growing up.
            - This sums up what was for a long time my political philosophy https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/07/archipelago-and-atomic-communitarianism/
                - Inspiration -- not spoken about above, is the idea of evolution, filling ecological niches. When there are major changes coming, it is good to have some real diversity of culture in case we all get swept up by a mind-virus (see that Neil Stephenson book -- diamond age, and snow crash
        - [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s [[Junto]], and the ideas of efficient learning, feedback loops, and collective intelligence and voluntary mutual aid all stuck out to me as part of a similar theme because I was already thinking about what an open-source or peer-to-peer political and social movement would look like.  I was already willing to take for granted that networks (if built on the right infrastructure) would be smarter, more resilient, more free, and more just, than anything managed by institution regardless of whether who owned it. Victor's ideas stand out mostly because of how they support better ways of thinking and communicating, which are key to really doing collective intelligence well).
        - I def came across exponential thinking through [[Ray Kurzweil]], he also gave me the idea of trying to skate to where the puck is going to be (knowing how long it takes to develop an idea or company, and starting to work on it years before the market is lined up so you release it right on time). His stuff on transhumanism and the singularity is super super interesting, and really relevant to this when we talk about why we need a resilient culture and social infrastructure. But a lot of people have either heard it, or it scares them or sounds too weird to be plausible, so I'm torn on how much to use. At the core it is the same idea as Engelbart's Law and the feedback loops that create the Pareto Principle, his writing will have lots of examples besides Moore's law of these accelerating change phenomena.
