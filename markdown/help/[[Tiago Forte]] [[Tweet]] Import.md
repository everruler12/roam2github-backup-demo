        - The decline of Facebook groups is having interesting effects. There is truly no default for online communities anymore. I’m seeing lots of fragmentation, experimentation, and innovation in the space as people scramble for solutions

        - Prediction: individual courses will become more important than the schools they’re taught in

Theyll have their own brands, personalities, franchises, networks, with the school as a mere functional backend

Follows trend of hit-driven portfolios, like in music, Hollywood, VC

        - 1/ Here’s a thread on my current take on the online education market, which per below is absolutely exploding. It’s not as simple as “make an online course” as I’ll explain in a minute. It’s become a competitive market that has to be entered strategically https://t.co/e1oP1Xs9ez

        - Me: hey babe, are you mad at me?

Lauren: no I’m just feeling sad about our lack of communication today which is being expressed as anger and projected onto you

Fights don’t get less frequent as you become more self-aware, they just become more complex

        - It took me 6 years of self-employment to establish what feels like a complete financial system, in this order:

1. estimated tax payments
2. expense-tracking
3. quarterly financial reports
4. retirement contributions
5. insurance
6. payroll
7. savings
8. business financial goals

        - The more ideas you write down, the more you have

The more you tweet, the more things you have to tweet

The more you write, the more things you have to say

Publishing causes new ideas, not the other way around

        - I finally realized why I generally dislike consuming audio and video: I’m not able to use any of my strengths in reading speed/comprehension, info processing, note taking, deeper reflection, &amp; skipping/scanning. It’s like being stuck in the slow lane with steering wheel locked

        - My message is simple: the average person's workload no longer fits within an average human brain. Unless you expand that capacity, you'll have to either drastically limit your ambitions, or destroy your peace of mind trying to fit it in anyway

1. Read first 30%
2. Stop &amp; save highlights to a digital notes app
3. Add summary of how/when you think this material would be most useful
4. Search these notes next time you start a project 
5. Finish reading books most likely to be useful

        - 1/ This series by @wistia is one of the most interesting and effective pieces of media I’ve seen in some time. They hired video agency @sandwich to make 3 versions of the same video introducing their new product Soapbox: with budgets of $1k, $10k, &amp; $100k https://t.co/AXFPaIiHK6

        - Learning should be:

Automated, not accelerated
Informal, not highly structured
Systemic, not systematic
Pull, not push
Just-in-time, not just-in-case
Slow burn, not heavy lift
LIFO, not FIFO
Minimum necessary, not maximum
Accessed, not memorized
Passive, not planned

        - Ideas abhor a vacuum

Create a folder for a topic you want to learn about, and you'll soon start noticing things to fill it with

Set a more ambitious goal, and it will inspire bigger thinking

Publish your work to the world, and you'll soon be flooded with even more ideas

        - Fascinating. All human languages seem to have nearly the same info transmission rate, about 39 bits/second (twice the speed of Morse code). High density languages like German move slower to compensate, whereas low density ones like Italian move faster https://t.co/ti8mXtuQMw

        - Presenting my summary of The Body Keeps the Score, one of the most impactful books I've read in recent years:

https://t.co/x49aN0RjAo

It summarizes #besselvanderkolk 's decades of experience in the origin and treatment of trauma in mind, body, and heart
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186779642083995649
        - These questions speak to a growing suspicion I have: the way we teach students is totally opposite of how true experts learn

We spoon-feed them carefully prepared, sanitized, methodologically perfect packets of knowledge

What if that is actually sabotaging their learning? https://t.co/Yc1dPg0CF7
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1192696929865498624
        - I'm convinced that summarizing books is an underrated skill for learning

Not tweet-sized summaries
Not Cliff's Notes
Not bullet points or "main takeaways"
Not slide decks

Multi-thousand word, in-depth, comprehensive summaries of the book's message are incredibly valuable

Day 4: Answer one of them

Etc.

        - It is totally obvious that we will get to a point where every person has 3-4 coaches for different aspects of their life. A human life has gotten so complex it takes a team to manage one. This is why everyone is becoming a coach and it won’t slow down anytime soon

        - I can barely contain the excitement and certainty I feel about online education. It’s evolving, maturing, professionalizing as an industry as we speak. We’re about to see the emergence of the Harvards &amp; Stanfords of online learning with at least as much credibility and prestige
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194058643907530753
        - Any time I write for a European audience, I have to decrease levels of grandiosity, metaphysics, ambition, mystery, and claims by about 50% otherwise they won't have it. For Silicon Valley, increase them by 200%

        - My learning really took off when I submitted to teachers and mentors. Problem with exclusively self-directed learning is you systematically miss the same blindspots and biases https://t.co/NetQRTgttm

        - I find my intuition is usually 2-3 years ahead of my rational mind. What my intuition is telling me now I will only fully understand in 2022. This is why developing better self-awareness is akin to time travel

        - Critical skill today: being able to explain what you do in a way that is humble without being excessively modest, aspirational without being arrogant, and that communicates your passion for it while remaining accurate and informative

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193642997025562624
        - What if making education easier or more fun doesn’t make it better?
What if friction and failure are the most important elements for learning?
What if learning isn’t the instructor’s responsibility, but the student’s? https://t.co/bVbPOfoUN3

        - I think the killer use case for a Second Brain as I conceive it may be self-directed learning online. I don’t see how you can truly take advantage of courses, videos, blogs, other resources, free or paid, without a dedicated placed to structure this learning
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1198779363640004608

        - You can tell what a country values by seeing what “doesn’t count”

In Ukraine, beer is not considered an alcoholic beverage 

In Mexico, “agua” can include very high sugar juice 

In Brazil, if you say you’re vegetarian they’ll offer you chicken instead of beef

Escape Velocity: you can win by cheating but the victory is empty 

SimCity: infrastructure is boring but essential 

Railroad Tycoon: protect against unforeseen events 

Starcraft: humans are devious creatures 

Halo: sniper rifle or handgun

        - All real learning happens by accident. If you knew what you were going to learn, you would already know it, and thus wouldn’t have to learn it. Note taking is so powerful because it allows you to do something predictable and concrete to enable learning that is unpredictable
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201607857612836865
        - The key is to turn everything into an output. Every thought becomes a note. Every idea becomes a tweet. Every open loop becomes a task. Every theory becomes a blog post.

That’s the goal

        - A great student can gain immense value from a mediocre course

But a mediocre student won’t benefit from the best course in the world

It’s not about the course. It’s about how much of yourself you invest in it

        - More and more, I’m impressed by just how little information is needed to take most kinds of action. I think it’s because taking action generates information, and only info that is immediately relevant and timely

        - It’s really hard to take innovative educational experiments seriously, because any new experiment inevitably attracts the boldest, most motivated, and most self-reliant students, who naturally thrive in an open-ended, less structured environment. But they would succeed anywhere

        - I increasingly believe the ability to capture a note without specifying where it goes or anything else about it is the most important feature of a notes app. I can barely summon the motivation to capture notes most of the time and this is my way of life

        - There are 2 ways to live a simple life:

1. Abandon your dreams, scale back your ambitions, ignore what you truly desire

2. Double down on your dreams, scale up your ambitions, take hold of what you truly desire*

        - Gem of a thought from a convo with @kadavy I can’t get out of my head:

        - My motivation to exercise skyrocketed when I reframed it from “getting ripped” (which is about impressing others) to “regulating my nervous system arousal” (which is about achieving my own goals). Makes such a difference to align your habits with your values
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197983556493905920

        - How information has been organized through history:

By medium: books, music, art
By channel: radio, TV, pamphlets

        - The very best way to organize information is by date created – it is obvious, intuitive, universal, and can be generated automatically. Organizing by any other means has to have a very strong justification, and "actionability" is the only one I've found that qualifies

        - It is unethical to charge less for an information product than the level of commitment required to benefit from it. The problem isn’t that online courses don’t work. It’s that instructors have abdicated their responsibility to set the right expectations, especially via pricing

        - What would a solution to climate change rooted in abundance, instead of scarcity, look like? I think the key mental barrier to ppl accepting and acting to protect the climate is that it seems to require us being smaller, weaker, less imaginative, instead of more

        - I actually think books are just the right size. Otherwise, Cliff's notes and blog post summaries would have taken over the book market by now. It isn't the job of authors to succinctly summarize their own work. They are in fact the least qualified people to do so

        - I’ve migrated my digital notes collection to a new platform 3 times, and expect to do it another half dozen times in my lifetime. If we outgrow our bodies, homes, and beliefs, why shouldn’t we also outgrow our second brains?

        - Information hoarders are much like home hoarders:

Crippling loss aversion that prevents enjoyment
FOMO about anything they haven't acquired
Living/working spaces are cluttered and messy
Addicted to acquisition at the cost of aliveness

        - Anyone else notice a trend of ppl moving to Europe after they’ve “made it”? Usually after an exit or windfall of some kind, or maybe just early retirement with savings. Seems like once major career risks have paid off the lifestyle there has no downsides

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171539850224427008
        - 2/ First thing to understand: YouTube is completely consuming the low end of the market. There is simply no future for courses that cost less than a few hundred dollars, because “edutubers” will do it faster, better, and cheaper (for free!) than paywalled courses ever could
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186093680236486656
        - Your Kindle library should be a legion of 30% finished books ready and waiting to be finished when you’re actually ready to put them into practice. Treat the first 30% like a synopsis and prescription and the rest like the treatment

        - One of the biggest motivations for working on my second brain is witnessing my own remarkable cognitive decline just from my mid 20s to mid 30s. I don’t think I can maintain half the mental stamina I could 10 years ago
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177710679060447232
        - My longest term goal is to be disrupted. 

To have so much money &amp; power that I can afford to not respond to an imminent threat, to see that the market I’ve created is so big it’s worth someone attacking, &amp; to see my wealth redistributed among the youth...ah that’s the dream

        - 1/ I've realized there's a really deep way of thinking about ideas that I think you have to have to be able to curate ideas of others, combine them together, and build on them with your own work

I'd like help putting a name to this or references to existing terms

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179537109796835328
        - Twitter is a crowdsourced research tool with retweets instead of citations, comments instead of peer review, links instead of references, weighted according to past contributions as indicated by follower count
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1188689399929688064
        - The most amazing thing about trauma I’ve seen time and again is that it doesn’t go away with time. An 80 year-old man suddenly becomes a child again when he recalls the memory. It’s permanently locked into the nervous system until healed

        - This is the most unbelievable note I've ever seen at the end of a blog post. It actually scared me that I too might one not have mental suffering and thus not be able to write. Which is a very funny fear to have https://t.co/L1WHA7u0eP

        - 20/ No one wants “more courses.” They want the results, which more often come from paring down, doing instead of consuming, reducing info overload, holding them accountable, and everything else in my list above. Learning is not a commodity to be sold in bulk, like soybeans
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186106781644148736
        - I’m helping a friend through creating her own online course.

        - We're taking vastly more video footage than we have the time/skills to edit together into a final product. And on smartphone cameras that rival professional quality. The bottleneck has moved to the selection, triage, organization, editing stage = huge business opportunity

        - #1 priority for any app in which reading takes place should be “maintaining reader motivation”:

-Logarithmic scroll bar that moves faster as you go
-Breaking text into shorter paragraphs
-Ability to sort articles by length/reading time

        - 1/ I’m going down the rabbit hole on one of the most fascinating developments in online courses I’ve seen: investigative reporting-style YouTube videos about dishonest practices

        - If you wouldn’t be happy to see all your notes permanently erased, you’re doing it wrong. Destroying your notes through creative destruction is the goal, not meticulously hoarding them and treating them as sacred objects worthy of veneration. Your notes should be disposable

        - 22/ Everyone is looking for the next mega-platform, the “YouTube for education,” which has caused them to miss the groundswell of independent, indie, mostly solo creators on self-service platforms like @Teachable @thinkific @podia @Kajabi who are absolutely killing it
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186107789506072576
        - Every day I get DMs asking me “when are you switching to X?” with X being one of a dozen specialized note-taking apps

        - Checklists are over-rated. They only apply to processes that are stable &amp; systematized, &amp; making a checklist doesn't make them so. So it can only happen in retrospect, doesn't adapt to changing conditions, and provides false confidence that there is no risk involved

        - Great insight into why it's important to step away from something you're writing occasionally: the longer you spend on it, the more of what you "see" is actually in your head, not on the paper. Putting time/distance between the text and your head allows you to regain objectivity

        - My thesis: the best online courses are as complex &amp; difficult to create as companies, but also potentially as profitable &amp; influential.

        - When you first contemplate becoming a free agent, it may seem like you have to have all these immediately. You don’t. There are consequences or risks to not having each one, but you can live with them for a long time. Just focus on setting up one per year and you’re fine

        - There is nothing more valuable than an arch-nemesis.

It shows you have a strong position that's worth opposing. Most people never get that far. 

You can recruit your nemesis' energy into a binary star system of unlimited gravitational potential

        - Why are people so offended by this? With all the shitposting I do, this casual observation is what really gets to them? I think it touches on a sense of being alone, unsupported, unappreciated, and the idea that everyone will have a team of coaches feels too good to be true https://t.co/QcBybC5zHq

        - I'm thinking of collapsing my entire 3|Resources stack into a single notebook, and then just using search to find things there. Organizing it by topic doesn't work for all the reasons I originally developed PARA. Too many narrow topics that don't actually add value

        - I finally realized why I’m interested in lightweight media creation as an end in itself: at some threshold of ease of use, it stops being an all-consuming technical skill and becomes a meta skill that can be used to test ideas. We’re reaching that threshold now
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1176339985471066112
        - I don’t use mental models. I swim dynamically in the ever-changing vortex of raw data, synthesizing meaning out of pure volition. With no attachment to the past nor clinging to a desired future, I’m able to see reality as it is without any mediation by preconceived frames

        - My god I’ve just realized the fundamental flaw with showing “top highlights” in an article or ebook: it encourages you to go faster, to skip ahead, at just the moment you should be slowing down. What we really need is “worst highlights” which would be the right time to skip ahead

        - It’s beginning to feel like I’m treating the symptoms, the coping mechanisms and hypervigilance that keep ppl from doing their best work. Trauma seems to be the background to so much we take for granted as just part of the human experience. What if it doesn’t have to be?

        - The Internet is a culture that fetishizes knowledge as a sacred artifact, and learning is the holy ritual used to worship it. If you could have all the results of learning, w/out having to learn anything, wouldn't you take it? When you fetishize learning, you never consider this

        - Strangely, knowing a moderate amount about something is the worst place to be for further learning. It’s much more effective to know very little (beginner’s mind + help from others) or to know a lot (embodied expertise + experience)

        - What causes certain diseases/conditions to become labels of identity? Like celiac, paraplegic, schizophrenic, or being bipolar. We don’t call someone a “allergist” or even an “HIVer” so it doesn’t seem to depend on how permanent it is

        - @MichaelOvitz 7/ Film artists were once treated like mere service providers. Interchangeable and powerless and underpaid. Much like teachers today, they didn't have anywhere else to go to have their skills and knowledge monetized
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196914077299281921
        - @MichaelOvitz 4/ CAA rode this wave by aligning themselves completely with artists. They negotiated hard for their clients, and provided every service under the sun to make their lives easier. They became practically the enemy of the studios due to their advocacy for artists
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196912944073859072
        - @MichaelOvitz 3/ But as studios lost their stranglehold on distribution (through the rise of TV) they lost this power. Suddenly the most important resource was creativity, and artists saw a huge increase in their pay, control, freedom, and options

        - There’s no good term for “a narrated recording of someone’s computer screen as they perform a task”

        - Excellent essay by @jacobjpeoples on “service anxiety,” info overload, and giving up control over our knowledge to be able to leverage it. Summarizes my approach and that of @vgr toward info consumption and personal growth https://t.co/0zuJQr8LRA

        - I'm always confused when a draft reviewer asks "who is the audience for this article?" The audience is just me. The people reading it, and their psychology, is the medium. The words are just a delivery mechanism for shaping mass human psychology

        - 13/ Contributing to a cause: every purchase these days is evaluated through lens of social/enviro-responsibility, incl. info products. It’s increasingly a necessity that students feel they are enriching not just themselves, but a cause or movement, implicitly or explicitly
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186101101822529537
        - Psychology of refunds for info products is really strange

Either they try to make you feel better (I LOVED it...but can I have a refund anyway?)

Or they exaggerate how bad it was to justify the request (I learned absolutely nothing and it was a horrible experience...)
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184130699558715393
        - If I wanted a ballpark figure for how many people in the world currently use digital notes apps, how would I go about finding that? It could be rounded to nearest ten or hundred million. Besides going company by company adding up their estimated user numbers

        - We need a better name for "virtual workshops." Virkshops? Webinars are for one-way presentations, calls are for passive listening, conference calls are audio only and boring. What's a good name for active, hands-on workshops you just happen to do online?

1) the most important thing about a blog is that it's active (because ppl won't pay attention if it seems dead and outdated, but more importantly, because it provides a stream of constant feedback)

        - I’m getting really excited about this “selling my digital sleeve” idea. I’m going to do the auction around the new year, so winner has a year to prepare to move to Mex City. It’s going to be an entire lifestyle design process focused on creating a life from the ground up

        - @harmonylion1 But another example: To Read lists should be organized by project even before you read them. It’s usually very clear how an article will be useful by the title. So why not postpone reading it until that use is needed

        - @harmonylion1 All kinds. Another way of saying steps is projects, a sequential series of tasks leading to a goal. That’s why my PARA framework has projects at the top of the hierarchy. And a simple implementation is to only organize by projects and forget the ARA

        - @1Password 9/ This was very password/login-centric, but I think goes a long way to making it harder for someone to guess your login.

What other methods should I consider implementing?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161474808565026816
        - @1Password 5/ Almost all major sites support 2FA, which has you verify your login using an SMS message or Authenticator app. I chose the latter whenever possible, bec it's harder to hack and doesn't require internet access
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161474175103451137
        - @1Password 4/ Not much I can do for "unsecured websites" as far as I know. For "Two-Factor Authentication" it somehow tells you which sites support it, so I went through and turned it on for about 25 major sites. This was most time-consuming

        - @DanPierson Ah true. Cash in that time debt
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194118563340128256
        - @senthewanderer @NotionHQ Soon....
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1194113964180942849
        - @WilliamAEden Obviously you have to brag about it on social media. I mean come on, anti-signaling is hard work
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193704138166530048
        - @jeremyredleaf @kirisima @caveday I can do 5 if it’s not every day. Each incremental hour is exponentially more valuable
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193668348246147073
        - @Levotiate I wish. Unfortunately I decided to go the trad’l publishing route and everything needs to be rewritten at half the grade reading level
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193664089756774403
        - @TheAnnaGat It’s EDGY
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193663633424887809
        - @danieldibartolo @amazon Too much to describe here. My head almost exploded
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193660142757257217
        - @PhilipSkogsberg That's why PS is mostly about producing new works, not stockpiling summaries for their own sake
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193451039476727811
        - @timpastoor Always
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193030409082163201
        - @countrrculture @khemaridh @jonnym1ller Yes absolutely. I plan on summarizing it
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1191176874988208131
        - @f_j_j_ I don’t know analytics very well. I suppose I could try
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1190748249138683904
        - @_middlesister You’re alt normcore
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1190355685885669376
        - @MathewBernstein That’s just stressful. Like Lucy in the famous bonbon assembly line scene
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1190109655919452162
        - @FreddyMallet It’s directionally correct, which is what matters
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189892093176512512
        - @derrey Compression ;)

        - @cigardubey @GeorgesJanin No we ended up just deciding to spend time there
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189579082796679168
        - @elmkast Ferries or container + flight if necessary. It’s really a very minor problem
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189387119799783425
        - I’m thinking 4 years old. That’s how old my youngest sibling was when we moved to Brazil in 1998
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189386908939341825
        - @HiredThought Key reason to upgrsde for me was Pluraleyes. Automatic syncing of external audio with iPhone video. Saves hours
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189374577312292864
        - @DennisDemori @GeorgesJanin Haven’t experienced any of those. I think you’re thinking of California
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189359507354222592
        - Hm this seems pretty... accurate https://t.co/9aScbgLeTI
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189290449493733377
        - @FrontalDigital That’s too fancy for me. Just need a good background track
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1189028645861580800
        - @eminencefont @OlinCollege Perfect! Purchased
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1188474967077216257
        - @QiaochuYuan Perfect
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1188321683716767744
        - @vgr @visakanv Whereas first gen of podcasts had incredible guests just by virtue of existing
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1187930133211926528
        - @Malcolm_Ocean @QiaochuYuan @AdeleDeweyLopez @DavidDeutschOxf Very cool. I'm just beginning to explore this but I think those thoughts are on the right track
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1187426610456100864
        - @visakanv @BillSeitz @evernote Hah nice. A new unit of measurement
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186983608512327682
        - @Bazzaruto Thanks! It’s prep for a major pivot we’re planning. Stay tuned...
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186459099115876352
        - How many subscribers on your email list?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1186089313668227072
        - @ianlpaterson @ryanckulp @nealconlon @bentossell That's what they want you to focus on. But the tradeoff is giving up nearly all control for access to a customer base that honestly isn't a great one
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1185987107304558593
        - @clayhebert And then here when you’re ready: https://t.co/ich24oyATR
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1185936672946393094
        - @clayhebert Start here: https://t.co/TVbM6hfEOt
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1185936526443565057
        - @vgr That seems right. There’s a feeling of “I can’t swallow this” that seems to immediately proceed abandonment
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184979666966237185
        - @eli_schiff @StillUpMySleeve There’s a horseshoe spectrum effect I think. Highest status ppl have a lot in common with lowest: few obligations, lots of flexibility, don’t conform to standards/expectations, kind of weird, etc. But the side of the horseshoe you’re on makes all the difference
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184631324889337856
        - @KarlNieberding Annoying thing is I was painfully skinny most of my life. I thought there would be a plateau of normalcy
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184582732552245250
        - @KarlNieberding Seriously considering it. Have a couple calls coming up with retreat organizers to see what it would cost
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184564875823058944
        - @josephrobison CDMX
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184560608022335488
        - @caseyames Isn’t that science fiction?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184257016308494336
        - @[[QiaochuYuan]] No I think that’s a complete cop out. The strongest possible signal that you don’t value what you’ve created. So why should they?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184223451646574592
        - Here's @aladmit_twit 's presentation at @KnowledgeConf 2019, summarizing my Progressive Summarization (heh) technique. 

Anyone willing to translate it to English for me? The automatically generated transcript in Russian is included below the video

    - 
        - @pierce_works My goal isn't necessarily to reduce refunds. If they aren't happy, I don't want to keep their money. It's more about how to use the psychology of refunds to increase their chances of success. To use it as an accountability mechanism/forcing function
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184159657121603584
        - @jhooks @coreyhainesco @brennandunn Is it merely the most well known though. How does one determine the most effective course on X?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1183178713426477056
        - I'll be in Seattle for a quick trip Nov. 7-11. Where's a good place for a casual meetup if I'm staying and working in Bellevue? Probably Sunday night 11/10
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1182770091324133376
        - @homsiT @Conaw No guys. I’ve talked to a dozen teams building idea mgmt apps in the last year. They’re mostly gone. Because they all built smthg to satisfy their personal intellectual itch rather than something ppl needed and wanted. You have to give up your personal fixation to make an impact
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181736960513081344
        - @Conaw It's a historical dead end. Everything Engelbart envisioned was pretty much realized in Microsoft Word
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181711768499802114
        - Really wanted to attend the Cirque de Soleil Crystal performance in Mexico City this weekend, but @TicketmasterME only accepts @Visa cards from SPECIFIC BANKS. I guess we're not going... https://t.co/8GhUvbs3Jp
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181708298006876160
        - @worldbrain It’ll always be something. Next blocker will probably be privacy
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181686195178205184
        - @kunksed @nateliason @notionpedia Yes, mine is personality centric. I basically don't think knowledge means anything outside of a personal context
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181637456040353793
        - @davidklaing @JimmyRis I think "capture" makes more sense for tasks as in GTD, because tasks are basically non-existent &amp; ethereal until captured.

Collect makes more sense for ideas, because they are more concrete and visible around us. I can say "let me summarize the 3 ideas in this book" for ex
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181629378075037696
        - @brennandunn @ConvertKit @khemaridh @david_perell
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181349193710915584
        - @toddkovalsky Of clients? Anything and everything under the sun
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181346860557991936
        - @ryandemetz @Mappletons @mariepoulin Amazing! The power of remixed content, which is exactly what we’re learning
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181297933683085312
        - @danshipper @AskWonder Knowledge by the hour :)
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181271413082218496
        - @vgr No not at all. The game is just a game. It’s the thought that went into creating this system that is priceless
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181060633275404288
        - @david_perell Yeah that’s what I don’t understand. It’s a fundamentally different info consumption behavior than what I do
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181037636682600448
        - @harmonylion1 @visakanv It’s not quite that linear. My version is a little less directly coupled
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181014673405071360
        - @chiaracokieng SO good. I’ll probably get sued though
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181005548772151296
        - @JamesClear @visakanv Really? I never heard of that for books. Strikes me as similar to a “pre-header” on sales pages where they call out and qualify the audience: “Are you struggling with debt?”
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181005442006183936
        - @joey_wickham I don't really find any negative effects. The motivation to just keep with it over long periods seems to outweigh any downsides of not sticking to an idealized schedule
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180888715977052160
        - @ramshead01 I’m not sure if they are. If I remember correctly there were committees and laws for determining which classification a person fell into
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180691597844828161
        - @khemaridh @Mailchimp It should go down after a month but yeah
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180539705030348800
        - @tendon @davidklaing Presumably to maximize throughput
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180525414252339205
        - @helixly Good example. No one learns how to tweet by spending time on Twitter. They learn it by having an interesting life and ideas and projects and a good twitter stream is a side effect
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180132987649720320
        - @allenthird Summarize what you’ve learned in one tweet
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179989396705005568
        - @jonnym1ller No single resource can be comprehensive enough while also having enough depth. This is the problem with "how to create a course" books/courses/programs. They're trying to teach a dozen really hard skills all at once, and ending up teaching none of them
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179890812634554371
    - 
        - @grigorimilov It is for me. I have no appetite for working with boring ppl regardless of how profitable it is
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179860298334785536
        - @HiredThought @map_camp Tshirts? Oh that’s good
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179857810558840832
        - @alexshye Yes definitely
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179856353952591872
        - @faustroll Is it really? After all these years? Incredible
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179856233781592064
        - @uberstuber 1. Focus on smartphones + super lightweight equipment 
2. Emphasis on note-taking, idea mgmt, &amp; just in time methods
3. Meta thinking around why and how to tell stories to produce certain results 
4. Inclusion of feedback and testing as a major component
5. Live delivery + cohort
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179845565217030144
        - I’ll be in São Paulo Dec. 8-13 staying in Brooklin/Campo Belo. Where’s a good place to do a little meetup around there on a weeknight?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179610170655035392
        - @vgr I think it's similar to how therapists don't need to know every detail of your past, and in fact by taking it too seriously can reinforce or give too much weight to past limiting beliefs
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179594761172176897
        - @timcasasola Yup
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179517836223401984
        - @JDanielRicher It’s the basic idea that proliferating courses by sheer number have any kind of impact on students OR teachers. Without regard to deepening the quality and impact of each one
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179492141271326726
        - @saurabh That seems much lower than for the US
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179251346911965185
        - @angelinaValdez The sweet bliss of productivity coursing through your veins
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179090062929203202
        - @cagrimmett @studioneat Yup!
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179089951121649665
        - @mwotton Ah yes perfect
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179045351560368129
        - @clayhebert @pjrvs I think so. This graphic from the thread was also super helpful. We’re in #2 so that’s reassuring https://t.co/j3VsKSVM8p
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179042651846262784
        - @hvasquez @lmeyerov @twwilliams Yeah 12 months is an enormous amount for a solopreneur. And if they do have that much, it’s probably wiser to invest it elsewhere
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178901994422947840
        - @unindie @NotionHQ Does that work on mobile/on the go?

        - Vou estar em São Paulo no começo de Dezembro. Qual o melhor lugar para fazer meu workshop O Processo Criativo? Precisa ser um bairro central em um lugar não muito caro
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177709191022006272
        - @jrmygrdn That would align with the method with the fourth step being Express

        - @NotionHQ 13/ I have to admit, having a really effective and reliable digital note-taking system is essential for this to work. You have to be able to capture any idea or note, from any source, at any time, and trust that it will find its way to one of the 40 posts you have in progress
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171219276214128641
        - @NotionHQ 12/ Everyone is doing a constant stream of these things, but it's scattered and mostly hidden. Your blog is where they become explicit and public, like a portfolio for anyone to see
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171219071938912256
        - @NotionHQ 9/ Your blog presents your work in a chronological timeline, which is a good default. But you can also use tags and categories to present subsets of the stream according to any criteria. For ex, all my posts related to BASB: https://t.co/DzDYcRk1XU
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171218402850922496
        - @NotionHQ 8/ Your "newsfeed of learning" is the central place where all your work takes place, so even if you promote posts on other sites, communities, blogs, and social media, all links lead back to the source, where you capture email addresses

        - Linear nature of tape invites splicing, reconstitution, remixing, and collage effects, echoing Dadaist experiments compiling poetry out of strips of newspaper. Sometimes secretaries had to literally cut and paste strips of tape https://t.co/aBv9PSMSDG

        - It’s amazing to read how many chemical and mechanical inventions were needed even at this primitive stage.

        - Originally, oral dictation was considered just as much a part of word processing as full screen text editing.

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170839017660866560
        - Word processing as a practice and a concept rode the wave of the “paperwork explosion” that executives faced, which was the earliest incarnation of the more general info explosion. WP both addressed the need to process more paperwork, and also contributed to it https://t.co/dfjtCQfzIE

        - @ryanckulp I think it’s because they are along an edge, are the only bit style graphics on the page, and the fading also makes it seem like a cloth
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163812210868514818
        - @hashemian01 That's a good idea. I should do a video about using G Suite for your Second Brain

        - @WillJHenry @Superhuman I’m told the product was partly inspired by my article One Touch Guide to Inbox Zero so I’d review that
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163516218155905028
        - @vgr I don’t know about Girard and at this point I’m too afraid to ask
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163189986486702080
        - @vgr Saw this also in Maximilian series about the Holy Roman Emperor and his marriage to duchess of Burgundy, which shaped a lot of modern Euro history. You’re never sure who the protagonist is, and it depends on your attitude to place and history
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163091758042927105
        - @RyFraz @ArrivedHomes 2 things I’d want to see to go all in on this:

1. REALLY strong credentials that this is fully accredited, certified, backed by the maximum protections as a tenant and an investor

2. The ability to move around the world to other properties owned by the fund, and furnished
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162510609910358016
        - @davidklaing @david_perell I have a two part series on curation, with a third one in the works. Members only though

        - @LjNaumov It's part of my series on Just-in-Time Project Mgmt, inspired by Agile, TPS, and Theory of Constraints. But it's paywalled sorry

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161664908573863937
        - @jonnym1ller @janelleallen Yes I’d be happy to. Email me
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161637327262740480
        - @MiGrant @1Password @OpenPhoneApp works well. Maybe 2/3 of verification texts go through but I think that has to do with the sending service
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161498477102325765
        - @1Password 6/ Authenticator apps are very easy to use. I use Google's free Authenticator app. You just take a picture of a QR code on the screen and then it generates a unique code which you then have to enter
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161474345077600256
        - @1Password 3/ I just went through the categories one at a time, changing passwords that were compromised/vulnerable (according to recent leaks), reused (for more than 1 acct), weak (too short or easy to guess)
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161473752175001602
        - @TheRoyalTbomb It's way easier just outputting it all and letting the crowd decide, then trying to manage it all in your head

        - @procrastiwork @marionnjoya I just use Kindle on iPad and export highlights. I don't use the notes feature though
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161019676538728448
        - @reneefishman @visakanv Same here. I resisted that label for years, since there was no single incident. But I was surprised to read that neglect is actually worse than other more direct kinds of trauma. And neglect can just be not getting what you needed
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160933955626926083
        - @RaymondDuke Yes me too. For groups though it’s still a bargain

        - Whereas the eternal mystery of which airport lounges I’ll have access to with Priority Pass, whether they’ll be open, have food, be too crowded, have good coffee, etc. keeps me guessing and it’s always fun https://t.co/s5jXwQ6lLc

        - @BillSeitz @jchris They're too easy. I don't want this to become yet another hopelessly pedantic and idiosyncratic "theory" that lives on a blog somewhere, and nowhere else
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160591010369433600
        - @oliviercantin We’re doing that too but there’s a limit to the speed of feedback loops online. All the great ways of working were tested intensively live
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160562913423216646
        - @jchris Not just banker types, but non techie nerds. Anyone who is more mainstream is a good test of the applicability of this way of working
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160490071197270017
        - @nollindwhachell Yes, it's a cycle in both directions. If you don't know what you should create (quality), get started by creating a lot of things (productivity). Quality is an emergent phenomenon

Quinta-feira é meu workshop O Processo Criativo: https://t.co/mcH8KJiTnn

Vem divertirse comigo!
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1204148697380065280
        - @Levotiate You have no idea how easy a book has to be written to become a bestseller these days
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1193665027426918403
        - When you sign up to an email drip sequence (series of pre-written emails), how do you read the emails?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1188539311794339841
        - Casual and comfy but also professional https://t.co/2hcUgavwY1
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1175163443550281728
        - Have you ever been to an event at a bookstore? Like a reading, signing, interview, or panel
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1173005926975934464
        - And even new devices are being created that explicitly recreate the minimalism and non-connectivity of bygone eras, such as the Hemingwrite, which was funded on Kickstarter https://t.co/cU5FCKWAQL
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171241700649357315
        - Text has gone from an object or artifact to more like an event, borrowing the concept of event sourcing from its underlying software. The “current draft” is not a single monolithic thing, but the emergent end result of all the typing events pulled forward to the present moment https://t.co/8Ls6lRu4Jc
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171099642785914886
        - But there are also miracles of recovery that wouldn’t be possible with paper, like digital archaeology https://t.co/1BPZelu5BY
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170906456964644864
        - Actual origin of the term “word processing” seems to be an interaction between an American and German sales execs, who used textverarbeitung, or “text processing” https://t.co/2vr8e3OiYy
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1170883389903319045
        - High price point of MT/MST encouraged businesses to reorganize their entire “internal system of text production” to fully utilize its capacity. You can see here beginnings of IBM’s eventual turn to consulting and selling integrated solutions https://t.co/pmHUzNZDBZ

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201571045129498629
        - @schlagetown All of the above. It's simply where everyone already is. I only engage actively with paid community during cohorts. And most of these platforms ppl self-manage

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201264373307604992
        - @khemaridh Yes we need an address we can use everywhere, not just for emails

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201264092700262400
        - @irinimalliaraki Yes, this is why we’ll still need schools. But schools will be designed around breakout courses, instead of the other way around
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1200857578122530816
        - @lingosteve I actually don’t think that’s going to happen. Instead we’re going to skip certification altogether. Ppl will get jobs based directly on their participation within these communities. Third party certs won’t be able to capture the true quality of this kind of learning
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1200540380342575104
        - @AustinLieb Yes exactly. You have to make your own hits
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1200524260202176514
        - @Levotiate Over time the market will learn. Fake gurus are mostly a sign of an immature market. But it’s quickly professionalizing

        - There were some issues: only had voiceover from me, some clips have bad lighting, and different framerates was tricky. We’ll need to standardize our shooting in the future

        - @rforster262 @MichaelOvitz I think the younger the student, the longer it will take to go online and more regulated it will be. Although I recently say an article that kids are watching so much Peppa the Pig that they’re developing British accents so might not take long
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1197162834154508290
        - @JeremieRykner Yeah it seems like agencies themselves eventually get disintermediated as well. Might just be a transitional form

        - @max_eyr Yes definitely. Studios balked when actors/directors started to demand % revenue share in their films. But it quickly proved worth doing because the most popular artists almost guaranteed the success of the films they appeared in. Similar will happen in education I think
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196925624755077120
        - @MichaelOvitz 16/ My question: what do the talent agencies and full-service VCs of online education look like? Who will broker the quickly shifting balance of power between teachers and institutions and students? Who will sell the shovels?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196918746817990658
        - @MichaelOvitz 15/ This doesn't mean brands won't matter. In fact they'll matter more than ever as the market fragments. But they will be brands not defined by geography of a school building, but by interests, passions, beliefs, goals – by niches, wherever they are located
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196918540252655618
        - @MichaelOvitz 14/ I believe even today this segment is undercounted, because what they offer often doesn't look like a "course" (memberships, masterminds, coaching, content). This is because they are the first online-first educational format, unlike the others grafted on from trad'l schooling
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196918322320879619
        - @MichaelOvitz 12/ Just as movies became brands unto themselves, courses will too, with spinoffs, sequels, merchandise, toys, multilingual translations, live conferences, meetups, cosplays, fan clubs, cult classics, syndication and serialization

        - @anim2407 Logos are fine for true clients. It’s BS when it’s “employees at these companies use us” because that carries zero meaning
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196502998157025280
        - @cigardubey If you want to build a business, you’ve gotta go with owned platforms like Teachable. If you want primarily credibility, exposure, thought leadership resume entries, etc then the marketplaces are fine

        - @eli_schiff @StillUpMySleeve Yeah it’s all in how you do it, not what you do. The skill required to frame and execute these effectively is ALSO part of why they’re meaningful signals (everything proves my point in other words)
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1184609494585622528
        - @eli_schiff @StillUpMySleeve Yeah these can all go very sideways. But that’s in part also what makes them valuable and expensive, the risk that you take on. Only elites can afford to take on risk

        - @StillUpMySleeve No they benefit from the watering down of credibility signals. Because the most expensive ones are more expensive than ever

        - @StillUpMySleeve The elite never get bigger, the bar just keeps vetting higher. The purpose of the elite is to be exclusive, and theyll do whatever it takes to maintain that

        - @creativepockets I’ve always thought this would be a great accountability mechanism. It would make ppl focus on creating value here and now, instead of in some far off future

        - @Ceasar_Bautista @Conaw That’s because it’s not a good model at all. Knowledge and it’s mgmt are not nearly as formal, explicit, disembodied, abstract, or technical as those old white guys thought. It’s like trying to model modern tech on steampunk paradigms.

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181603362359275520
        - @tasshinfogleman That the collection phase is not natural or intuitive for people. It needs its own step.

It actually makes sense when moving from the 5 steps of GTD: Clarify is replaced by Distill and put later to be done just in time, and Review is eliminated
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181603248009953281

        - FYI if you turn the “extra meeting participants” add-on in Zoom off and on a few times, they make you go through a huge hassle and contact sales, get a quote from provisioning, and accept the quote. They don’t want you turning it on and off as needed

        - @PhilipSkogsberg It IS the general reference filing system GTD recommends, combined w/ project support materials. I’ve found that you can have more granular folders, as many as you want, as long as they are organized into buckets based on actionability, so you’re always looking at most actionable

        - @twwilliams @hvasquez I’d estimate using total cost basis. But that’s pretty low for remote work

        - @hvasquez That’s a good one. So if their salary is $100k per year, you want about $32-48k in the bank as a buffer

        - @KristinFernholz No I bought yeti as my first mic and have never looked back
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167178217691602945
        - @KristinFernholz I really like the yeti mic and many others use the snowball. Practically the standard for USB mics

        - @ejames_c @therealpaulcook Whoa incredible! It’s like a personal letter addressed to me. You should publish this as a blog post. Super valuable stuff
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167173573452029952
        - @angelgonzalez Hard to estimate, but it's equally the meaningful and creative work that gets squeezed out by all the BS work. You can put up with anything if it is meaningful

        - @Jonas_Sota Yes exactly. Ppl with “simple” lives often have very complex systems working for them in the background

    - 
        - @CmdrDats @RobStuttaford It’s not more work, it’s different work. You’re already acquiring the info in your daily life. The choice is whether to spend your time remembering/tracking it, or offloading it to a machine that remembers perfectly

        - @khemaridh I only use Important and Other. Since some things always slip through and thus I have to check them, I’d rather have fewer places to check
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166026010459983872
        - @AE_Robbert @rhyscass It seems like we can make a pretty weak claim that still is more than most ppl hold: that ideas obey rules, and thus can only be combined according to rules

    - 
        - @Conaw Problem is that intro and conclusion usually say the same thing. I do need some of the detail of middle chapters to tell how deep they’ve gone and at what resolution

        - @puritanner I'm looking for the underlying belief, which in this example would be "atomaticity" or something. The belief that atoms exist and can be used to build durable things
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165741567908466690
        - @AckKaero @dppetrov It might be constructionism, which I guess must presuppose that the things you're constructing aren't just whispy opinions
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165741325880307714
        - @LouisComments No it's something more fundamental that makes those both possible: just the simple belief that an idea is a definite thing
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165725655763431427
        - @Gluefactoryltd @NYUGallatin No I'm describing a specific, opinionated stance

        - @vgr I'd thought of doing just what you describe with index cards for next draft of book manuscript, because I need more friction to prevent too much detail from migrating to new draft

        - @then_there_was Yes. I have smthg on this that I’m publishing soon. Determine categories retroactively using ML

        - @then_there_was Yeah I don’t think it’s a note taking tool at all. The defining elements of notes are random capture and low fidelity, neither of which Notion does. It’s more in GDocs territory

        - @frogautistic @evernote @TheBrainTech @devontech You’ve got to balance the cost/friction of maintaining all these tools with the opportunity cost of what you’d be able to create otherwise. What matters is your output

        - This is a great video where Comedian works out loud thru his process for note taking, sense making and personal knowledge mastery. Love the pipeline idea &amp; how ideas are refined. So much to learn here about managing digital overwhelm https://t.co/hTqMrTsb7R HT @fortelabs

        - Discovering 'Building a Second Brain' by @fortelabs  was such a zero-to-one moment. Initially I thought the title was a bit pretentious, but after I hear the pitch it all made sense. 

Realized how much information overload that we consume everyday.

        - Publishing blog posts takes me longer than passing legislation with my fear/perfectionism. My story is I can't write; I come off as a fraud-narcissist. I think of how 1 post will lead to the demise of my career like I’m in a Final Destination horror film. https://t.co/ir5i5U9A7l

        - This is such an interesting and fun thread, with all kinds of little details — if you love writing &amp; writing tools you’ll love this. One thing (of many) that struck me was how expensive tools used to be and how luckier we are today than I tend to be really aware of. https://t.co/NRZiQHG8Kg

        - @garybasin No it’s a designer. But focused on direct response not aesthetics
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1203249592655077382
        - @joelrunyon @david_perell That’s harder to casually drop in conversation though. Too wonky
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1203051772417314816

        - @pierce_works Oh yes
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1203034133204787203
        - @tvanantwerp No because going for 80/20 on the stuff that's 80/20 only gives you 16% return. It's just math I don't make the rules
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202652548236075008

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202646690437591040
        - @KeenDisregard Test the idea first via tweets. But not the kind of writing you’re doing here which sounds like it’s from a corporate brochure or academic paper. What’s the riskiest thing you have to say? One tweet
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1202629173266636801
        - @chophshiy I can tell you that wouldn’t be effective

        - @brunowinck @masterclass Thanks! The challenge is the time commitment which is hefty. But if you take a few courses per year and make resources out of them like I showed it’s probably worth it
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201656046462234624
        - @khemaridh Ah it’s a daily sequence. Why not just add a 1 day delay the day before and schedule the broadcast for that gap

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1201551496648642564
        - @TomFrankly No because knowledge is infinitely fractal. The more you learn, the more you discover you don’t know. This is who ppl end up dedicating their career to South African burrowing sand beetles or whatever

        - @impcapital No I totally get it. Returns are for squares. But what’s the amount you’re expected to play with?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1200457387347365888
        - @clayhebert Problem is “needing info” is such a ln abstract pain. Most ppl don’t think that way. It’s more like sunk cost + loss aversion from already having spent so much time reading and wanting to not let that go to waste
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1200106673982959616

        - @svincenzi @max_eyr So it’s as if the talent agency employed the actor. I wonder why they don’t. Probably because actor wants freedom to work with anyone
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196937889634017281
        - @svincenzi @max_eyr Versus freelancing? But some of the top devs also freelance don't they?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196930517737672704
        - @grigorimilov @MichaelOvitz Maybe the scale of sheer numbers, but not profitability. The more niche, the more profitable
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196926793707601921
        - @max_eyr Any notes on it?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196926637532684292
        - @grigorimilov @MichaelOvitz Yes but ppl will pay far more for education for this reason
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196925896449544196
        - @svincenzi @MichaelOvitz That is one of the assumptions of the old model of education that is about to be destroyed: that quality of instruction declines with size of class
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196920068350844928
        - @MichaelOvitz 13/ Which courses are profitable or successful will be harder to predict. Sure bets will flop without creative enough marketing, while niche plays will have breakout success as they resonate beyond their niche. Courses will resemble startup investing, with 1% creating most profit
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1196917294649270274
        - @MichaelOvitz 11/ This means you'll see indiv instructors competing and/or collaborating with major educational institutions as equal players. Look out for partnerships with Ivy League universities, governments, military, and school systems outsourcing some courses to online teachers

        - @Joelliechty PARA is simply the structure of your second brain. Human brain has limbic system, neocortex, prefrontal cortex. Digital brain has projects, areas, resources, archives
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1192175681469206528
        - @Joelliechty It’s more that resources are only one kind of info that has value. Others are project materials, area materials, and archives. Or I guess that everything is potentially a resource

        - @CatalystLWH What’s the info revolution? Did I miss it?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181035311188496384
        - @DrewLevy No I think these are better. Nearly everyone’s reactions are instantaneously more positive and enthusiastic. Impossible to ignore
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1181005914150559744
        - @garybasin Thanks!

        - @richtesoriero It's not named for an Arnold Schwarzeneggar movie
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180970223861551105
        - @Knipps But then the first clause is overloaded compared to the second
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180940364116459520
        - @olaf_alex No. Two items instead of 3. 50% less complexity
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180937333127778304
        - @Knipps You mean the comma?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180937236939853825
        - @JimmyRis Yes I know. But transactional has a very bad connotation for most ppl
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180927531785936896
        - @JimmyRis I think that entire field is basically a non-started in terms of language. It's like scifi when I'm selling productivity. I'm trying to avoid it
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180927356342423553
        - @JimmyRis oh well thanks
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1180926725741432832
        - @viveksworld It's not primarily financial though

        - @olaf_alex I want to avoid listing things in my subtitle

        - @shamohit711 Hm maybe something about "expanding your brain" or "amplifying your thinking"

        - @alon_gilboa @m_ashcroft Yes but don’t get a haircut the day before like I did. Takes a few days for hair to settle
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179924555474882560
        - @alon_gilboa I’d keep the beard

        - @Aboundlessworld Yeah but I don’t think completion is the right metric for success here
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179892121903357952

        - @Jonas_Sota That’s really hard to track and track down

        - @IbarraDiego On the other hand, I’m not going to put one on my website that makes me cringe

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179877496650530816
        - @wobbles Hm I forgot to exclude online classes from institutions which may be over $1k in credits
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179856935710912514

        - @Mattrud I’ve never met anyone who wrote a book who didn’t have a lot of help from many different sources
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179856019939160064
        - @Mattrud Did someone write a book based on reading your book?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179849773030858752
        - @m_ashcroft Not in my experience

        - @AkitaOnRails @thiagoghisi Ok cool I have a couple good leads
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179848064904777728
        - @rjonesy Ok starting a list

        - @s_ketharaman Does Google Play show download numbers?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179844300844097536
        - @daysofwaves It will cost way more. Other courses need to be managed by others before I do that though. It’s all consuming
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179842938077097984
        - @tasshinfogleman I think that one will have to wait until BASB book is out. 1-2 yrs
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179842806484881408
        - I should probably prototype this using a live workshop. It’d be $1k in person in NYC or LA. Not including travel/food/board. Two very full days on a weekend. Who would be down for this?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179839483132276736
        - @thiagoghisi @AkitaOnRails Oh really? I have no sense of where the commercial and business districts are because I never lived there as an adult
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179837184595001344
        - @staticsteven Not for such a broad request. See my blog first
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179830864592551936
        - @JuanSerantesG @micahtredding What can be convergent, but usually people know what to do, just not how to do it
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179830654608871424
        - @learningpathsio @evernote It can't be that hard to get a round ballpark. Don't ppl track software category usage?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179830459322093568
        - @mesaulosoares I'll send it out more broadly once I decide on a date and place
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179830328233353216
        - @visakanv Well Evernote alone has over 200MM so that's a safe guess
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179793585819938818
        - @tonyennis Ok I'll try it
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179793424511164417
        - @Zenomercer Yes only dedicated ones
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179791098962513920
        - @learningpathsio That’s a good idea. I’ll look into it

        - @purchalka Yeah it’s a rarified world
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179767552748113920
        - @cuongish Yes, it can never be completely automated, because the magic is in the process
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179767489007439875
        - @thiagoghisi @AkitaOnRails Why because of metro access
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179767141060534274
        - @kalenjordan But that implies live broadcast, aka live-streaming, which isn’t the case. They’re pre-recorded and uploaded to a course
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179496698642604038
        - @nollindwhachell But it will smile awkwardly if trained on my data

        - @david_perell It looks ok in the video. It’s more the camera I’m using to take this picture

        - @VincentBarr Let me check and see

        - @AvalancheJohn Didn’t know those were the choices
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1179056781936545792
        - @clayhebert @pjrvs I read the book and loved it. But there are many aspects of the business that are highly operational and systems/process oriented that I don’t want to run. And I don’t think automation works in an education business in my case. And contractors haven’t worked out for this
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1178879609095348224
        - @Tablatodd Love it. Do you have a couple screenshots of this in action?

        - @covrter What is that?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177683812991373312
        - @royking3 A little corny
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177683366872666112
        - @covrter That's better, but still too "manufacturing"
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177682308448411648
        - @chandra1250 No too absctract
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177682256892063744
        - @Fernand0Aguilar I don't think "creative goods" is commonly understood

        - @PhilipSkogsberg Resources is the broadest possible term, encompassing things like stock photos, device manuals, or reading highlights that aren’t exactly hobbies. Areas are specific to you, such as your health records, whereas Resources are general interest, like health articles

        - @CantHardyWait It needs to be double booked sometimes though. Issue is we use it for everything from one on ones to big groups
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177038653710749696
        - @CantHardyWait Financially. It feels like a side effect of the pricing model, which assumes high intensity use of each host, when really what we need is just unique IDs and only occasionally simultaneous use
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1177029519850369025
        - @CantHardyWait Their margins improve, but not mine until I get really big and get volume pricing

Organize: information and ideas
Unlock: ideas and creative output
Unleash: creative output and creative potential

Harness and master are broader, could apply to the whole thing

        - @grigorimilov Studios. But this would be more grassroots

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172987258468614144
        - @grigorimilov Well since what they’re selling IS communication, ie text, yes. Few ppl want to buy straight journalism
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172985255738740736
        - @chophshiy Yes. Anyone can gain a few dozen glowing reviews. Hundreds or thousands is impossible

        - @kirisima Yeah it’s an interesting gender split. I think it’s because productivity is more outcome oriented and “offense.” Whereas organization is more environmentally oriented and “defense”

        - @daysofwaves Yeah it’s really a big need. As far as I’m concerned no one should even think about creating an online course until they’ve taught it in person many times
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172677256331661314
        - #2 might seem like an obvious yes but consider that you might NOT want a larger percentage of each retail sale, instead using the book to sell something else like a course or speaking

        - @creativepockets Content has become a pure commodity. Every day thousands of excellently produced YouTube videos get published on every topic. So coaching can’t be about delivering content anymore, it has to move more toward accountability

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172311367715414019
        - @danielkmezam Yes, but that’s “access date” not “date updated.” Often something gets accessed often BECAUSE it doesn’t change

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172302152661786624
        - @maxholzheu Depends on how much effort it takes to make the other ones meaningful. If it takes you a ton of effort to apply tags for example, it’s better to default to date created

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172275299968520193
        - @atthatmatt Yeah hard to compete with free
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172274133062864896
        - @atthatmatt It’s twice as useful but requires 10 times more effort to keep track of at least. So net ROI on attention is less
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172272420968914950

        - @buster Speed was never important in the publishing process, so I think there's a lot of bureaucracy and delay in every little step. But speed is now paramount, not just if you're writing about tech but for everything, since the zeitgeist evolves so much more quickly
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1172198447044128768
        - @buster It should be faster. There's no inherent reason for it to take that long, besides the legacy structure of the industry

        - The widget feature on iOS and notification drawer on Android provide a way to add or search for notes without having to open the app, or even unlocking the phone. iOS instructions: https://t.co/M0rdXuIf0E https://t.co/B8hwZrJRJy

        - @davidjoelhall Cool. I’m looking for ways that are faster or easier than opening a notes app and typing though

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171966880883458048
        - @garybasin I know right. But there’s simply no word like it. Well, system or process is pretty close but not very subtitle-friendly. The Life-Changing MAGIC of Tidying Up though it’s clearly a process

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171956490917183488
        - @garybasin I’ve been trying idea management. It’s better than knowledge mgmt but still not something that is immediately clear
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171956284087603201
        - @Malcolm_Ocean @garybasin That’s a good idea. Challenge is that it’s quite a long journey from raw ideas to concrete results. If I focus too much on former it feels vague. Too much on latter it doesn’t explain how
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171955868918669312
        - @garybasin Well that’s not the driving concern but it’s a reflection of how people evaluate new things – connecting it to what they already know
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171955215236382720

        - @TomLisankie Yeah I should have said 60 and 80, but ppl usually use a 10 point scale for attractiveness
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171270928220557312
        - How close are you in attractiveness to what you consider the ideal attractiveness for happiness in life? On a scale of 0-100. So if I think I’m a 6 (or an 8) and ideal is 7, then I’m 10 points away

        - Looking back, word processing created new kinds of work rather than eliminating the need to work, and coexisted alongside other kinds of writing rather than replacing them wholesale https://t.co/BJdxvhmkrC
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1171257422855299072
        - Word processing has been both dematerialized and commodified into an old fashioned, self-conscious activity that we evoke under very specific circumstances. But it’s also now ubiquitous, something we do all the time and everywhere across so many platforms https://t.co/GJg0HE5FIR

        - Word has definitely received it’s fair share of criticism of course. Among them, that in fulfilling the vision of word processing, it enshrined the document as the privileged artifact, instead of the text itself, which can get obscured https://t.co/nGODvSdjjy

        - @parker_gibbons Ok cool I’ll try it
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168659849766289409
        - @laurentmtl Why’s that?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168643307808989190
        - @SachinB91 It has done the job, but I’m looking for more variety and probably need to start licensing
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168616108829618176
        - @syalam Yes
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168600039523901447
        - @davidklaing @eupsychian No life is way easier, but more complex partly because we all have the possibility of thriving, not just surviving
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168581589405769729
        - @northerncomfort Yeah, the same way everyone has multiple devices which once seemed unimaginable
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168533684829294592
        - @stephenpratley Sales taps into existing beliefs more I would say
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168533190048247808
        - @schlagetown I think there’s something else though, a built in premium because most serious videographers really need the tools. A book on editing I just bought for ex cost $36 for an ebook
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168532772857626626
        - @davidklaing That’s a dumb example. Human life gets higher order, more abstracted, more complex. We can’t farm a soybean but we can manage global soy supply chains

        - @RLangford18 Hypotheses or working theories. Beliefs are more personal
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168310962073436161
        - @______138190 I think fiction has many different kinds of impact, and value, but changing beliefs isn't one of them
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1168309674384355329
        - @RLangford18 I wouldn't call those beliefs

        - @HuanWin I watched the long video but I’m not convinced. My Asian eyes always look squinty so I try to open them more, but this seems the opposite. Do you have before/after examples?

        - @chophshiy Oh right but all this writing is for the book, which will be $10-15
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167619148156932097
        - @chophshiy 5-7 cent?

        - @stephanieetxe For now maybe yes, but it’s getting easier all the time. Lauren for ex asked to work remotely at a very traditional org and they said yes

        - @TaylorPearsonMe @joelrunyon Yeah I thought so. This one is more institutional and traditional investors. Fairly conservative I think. I think I’ll focus more on info overload and PKM Rather than anything new and crazy
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1167510581412163584
        - @stephaniesbell You recommend it?

        - @TheRoyalTbomb Yeah I find I can’t be too specific. I have to go by how I feel. And having 3 days for whatever comes up allows those 2-3 days to be truly free

        - @Jonas_Sota It can be too simple. It can be average, mediocre

    - 
        - @CmdrDats @RobStuttaford Yes but you need somewhere to put the pile
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1166776040305246208
        - @CmdrDats @RobStuttaford The issue is you need added capacity just to have the space to think about and re-engineer those things. Like how the first step to organizing a messy room is removing stuff from the room (into an extra space) so you have space to work

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165819459937816576
        - @garybasin But in a way it’s LESS subjective, recognizing the concreteness of ideas
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165808030484549632
        - @mtraven @Meaningness Perfect

        - @stubborncurias That’s good too
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165794147241840640
        - @Conaw Seriously?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165794092787175424
        - @mk270 I think this might be the closest
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165791993957470208
        - @BillSeitz @galtenberg These are things you can do once you have this mindset. But what is the mindset?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165791168845598720
        - @davidoudiette That's part of it. But almost a side effect. In a way, ideas get less reified when they are more concrete and interchangeable
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165742362632609792
        - @chophshiy That's good. Like evolutionary fitness, but for ideas. But what is the thing that makes that work? Something like "genes are discrete, durable, and interact in reliable ways." That, but for ideas
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165742182726324224
        - @vgr That seems right, but it seems like there should be a term for this mindset since not everyone shares it. Something like "composability" but for ideas instead of code
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165741847827927041
        - @galtenberg Reality Hunger is a great word for it. But there's still something more basic than this process. The perspective that must exist in the first place – that ideas are concrete things
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165741176730923008
        - Any help @vgr? I think I learned this from you
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165722708811948033
        - @john_c_palmer No it's something more like an attitude, orientation, philosophy, or even ideology, not just a step
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165722520496082944
        - @vgr This is great. It sounds very similar to how I use Evernote, and why I don't miss fancy features: build up rich nodes asynchronously/serendipitously over time, and then assemble them together just-in-time, right at moment of synthesis/creation
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165719976101195776
        - @then_there_was It’s the sunk cost fallacy turned in your favor. Oh well I’ve already created this folder, might as well fill it with stuff...

        - @Its_itz_ It’s only a couple hours, not so bad as a wage I don’t think. I guess they have to do the return trip for free though
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165401616431771648
        - @galtenberg I think a lot of that can be done as a manager though. I know it can for my work which I consider of similar complexity

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165049900058345472
        - @YoFolyo Interesting question. Depends on what better means. I like it more since I don’t have to rehash material. But it also means it can be hard to move into new domains
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1165031663773966336

        - @KyleAPennell Curiosity is the self-replenishing resource, since it grows the more you use it. The trades are trades in information, knowledge, wisdom, delayed gratification, decisions. Basically ways in which your past and future selves interact, either benefitting or screwing over each other

        - @CantHardyWait I wouldn’t actually guarantee the lease. It’d be an introduction and recommendation to the landlord, and risk would be up to them. Risk of staying in someone’s house with them is actually very high
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1163264039570427904

        - @vgr Specifically, I think there’s something in German culture that doesn’t fit things automatically into good vs evil, like US does. Likes to question them, reverse them, complexity them

        - @garybasin I will now

        - @RyFraz @ArrivedHomes For #1, I think the YC label is actually a detriment. Ppl don’t buy homes from startups

For #2, it’d be really hard to build up that kind of supply. But focusing on central areas of major cities would create a very cool internal marketplace

        - @nollindwhachell @BarrettValues Makes sense. Another version of that is becoming disembodied, totally detached from physical reality which is also no fun

        - @nollindwhachell @BarrettValues That’s pretty neat. Yeah this is like a bottom up, completely practical path to spiritual development. I can’t stand philosophy unmoored from reality, so this is my version I guess
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1162123654043447296

Unblocking the flow of ideas?
Unlocking your creative potential?
Unlocking your creative flow?

Unlocking might be more understandable than unblocking

        - @SebVollant Studied it for 4 years in high school and college but it gets too mixed up with Portuguese

        - @sidharthajha @focalsbynorth @evernote They start at $600. I buy way too much of this shit

        - @ESpacewalk @adamdavidlong What’s cross campus?

        - @bchjam But would Sat night be better? Then they just don’t attend for different reasons

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161670196169457664
        - @tasshinfogleman Yes but you also need long ones. There's a limit to how many small projects can be combined into big ones without some kind of vision
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161669938886709254
        - @HughIdris Nice
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161661774732468224
        - @StefanBielski I think so actually. Ppl everywhere are kinder, more empathetic, and more evolved than ever. But only in person

        - Anyone have any good recommendations for where to visit in Japan in the winter? We have two weeks in early January arriving and leaving from Tokyo
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161513067781459970
        - @M_K_E__ @1Password @LastPass Seems very secure
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161499015659347968
        - @BillDA @1Password Oh really? I’ll look into that
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161498867315200000
        - @adamdavidlong But having those codes around seems terribly insecure
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161498712667033600
        - @adamdavidlong Why’s that? So they can’t guess it?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161498632698421248
        - @adamdavidlong Oh nice
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161498549672120322
        - @ThomYokh No living for a couple years

        - @JacobSp00952700 About a day to gather research and create an outline, and a day to write and edit, total
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161469729376096256
        - @VISUALGRIT That would be really hard to make change for
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161469631883698176
        - @AnthonyCastrio No nearby
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161441651077681155
        - @adam__jun Well yeah you have to earn your keep
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161439277302988800
        - @kirisima Not sure I even knew most of the time. But I'll think about related issues
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161401012067979264
        - @kirisima They're doing the recording
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161397243347443713
        - @KarlNieberding Take notes

        - @patrickdavis228 Nice one

        - @jakeisschaeffer It was a pioneer but hopelessly outdated in a digital world. The most important feature of that system, a permanent unique ID, is now automatic and effortless using software
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161391850621755399
        - I’m withdrawing this recommendation in retrospect. Problem is that when typing normally, your palms push down on the corners pretty hard. The MOFT is just thick enough that the front edges are elevated enough to tilt in a very annoying way https://t.co/9cfmYyOnkP

        - @deepATL I think so
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161301762600390656
        - @equartey Pause and write it down unfortunately
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161301362627371011
        - @chpnorris Hm they must be responsive to the market then
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161094603077849088
        - @pcmaffey @jchris Sounds fun
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1161092528529035264
        - @chpnorris I’m sure they get help with pricing

        - @vikingux Yes absolutely

        - @SanchizeUnfltrd I can’t imagine much upside for a lamp

        - @DanielCBerman How do you think the matrix gets started?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160940483620691970
        - @fromnetwrkr It’s a secret
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160933638927601665
        - @ricardomacario @nntaleb Both are useful under different circumstances. When I need 15k words of exact quotes from a book, I’m sure not going to take those by hand
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160932863363043330
        - @derifatives I don’t think they do but I just notice that every factor is factored into the price
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160751995126308865
        - @staringispolite But where else?

        - @joelrunyon I’d be doing NYC Orange County
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160652451403505675
        - @BillSeitz @jchris Not easy as in they maximize its potential but easy to communicate with

        - @ElmarDott @cigardubey We visited there last month and it was charming but too small

        - @amelapay @impcapital Awesome
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160597502413824000

            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160597422768181248
        - @amelapay I'd like a Reality Phone
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160597395668783105
        - @kyleschen Haven't heard of it
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160597315473641472
        - @JaredMadfes @impcapital This sounds exactly like the kids I knew growing up in suburban Orange County though. I think this is just modern life
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160597138557947905
        - @JaredMadfes @impcapital I've heard of this. But we'll expose them to a wide range of places, people, cultures, etc.
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160596846177210369
        - @bierlingm Ah yes, that's nice
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160590834376437760
        - @perspectivalean Amazing. Thanks
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160563964733874176
        - @dougvk I could choose both home and work with no commute. So that would eliminate a fair bit of time and complexity
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160562690722394112
        - @LindseyHonari Leave New York? You mean like I’ll get stuck?
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160561006239571969
        - @tcdurant I’m starting to give up the idea that we’re going to have a permanent home, even with kids. I think 1-2 years at a time now. It’s more like allowing each place to “rub off” on my work/myself. SF and MC have been good but there is an east coast flavor missing
            - https://twitter.com/fortelabs/status/1160560747916562433
        - @bchjam I grew up in Orange County. So LA is already always
