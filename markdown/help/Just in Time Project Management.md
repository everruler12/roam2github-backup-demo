            - Technology has transformed every aspect of business, from the tools we use to communicate and collaborate, to how products and services are built and delivered, to how we conceive of organizations and communities.
            - But it hasn’t yet transformed the heart of how we manage and execute work – [[Project Management]] (PM).
            - A new paradigm for project management in the digital age has a few requirements:
                - Digital-native, not only allowing but assuming that most work will be completed using digital technology and online
                - Explicitly enable knowledge workers, who are no longer an exotic curiosity, but the dominant economic force in the world
                - Thrive in the face of uncertainty and change, not only surviving but excelling in the face of the VUCA (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) we find ourselves working in every day
                - Accommodate any team or organizational structure, adding value regardless of whether a project is being completed by a single freelancer, a team of contractors, across organizational boundaries, or by traditional employees
                - Leverage emerging digital technologies, remaining open to and expecting new capabilities to become available regularly
                - Operate through and within networks, taking advantage of existing platforms and ecosystems to learn and move faster
                - Integrate deeply with learning, making continuous improvement synonymous with work itself
                - Assume remote collaborators, capitalizing on the advantages of distributed teams while neutralizing their disadvantages
                - Maximize return-on-attention, explicitly recognizing that attention is our most valuable resource
            - These are the requirements I’m committed to fulfilling over the course of this series. Let’s begin by defining the key metric of Just-In-Time Project Management (JITPM): Return-on-Attention.
            - ### The fall of [[Return-on-Investment]]
            - By the 1950s, American automaker General Motors had become the largest company in the world¹. Its methods were studied and copied by industrial corporations around the world, becoming the first widespread use of “systematic management.”
            - Of all the new practices that GM developed, the most influential has been Return-on-Investment (abbreviated as [[ROI]]).
            - The logic is straightforward: any given project has a required input (or investment), and an expected output (a return). We’ve all heard that “It takes money to make money.” By dividing the return by the investment, we get Return-on-Investment, a very simple metric that tells us “what came out” in terms of “what went in”:
            - ![](https://i2.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/148-149.001.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)
            - If I invest $10,000 into a project and it returns $11,000, that project had an ROI (Return-on-Investment) of 10% (the profit of $1,000 divided by the original investment of $10,000). It doesn’t matter how big or small a project is, how short or long it takes, or how it gets paid back. As long as it can be boiled down to inputs and outputs, we can arrive at a single number called ROI.
            - ![](https://i2.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/149.001.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)
            - ROI transformed business decision making for one reason: it allowed executives to compare different projects to each other directly.
            - This was extremely important in 1950s America: it was a land of seemingly unlimited abundance and opportunity. Even GM couldn’t invest in every project, so it needed a quick but effective method for choosing which ones to commit to at every level of the company.
            - But times have changed, and it’s no longer a matter of picking the lowest hanging fruits in an economy growing by double digits every year. Every industry is hypercompetitive, and opportunities need to be created, not simply chosen. Now we need to nurture promising projects, products, and situations to profitability.
            - But it takes an incredible amount of sustained attention to see a project through to completion. Especially as we are besieged by distractions on all sides, and new and “better” opportunities seem to come along every five minutes.
            - Like time, the supply of attention is finite. But unlike time, we don’t automatically get 24 equal units every day. With the rise of social media and freemium business models, our attention is increasingly a resource that can be mined by anyone. If we don’t spend it on projects of our own choosing, there are many others all too willing to invest it in their own.
            - ### The rise of [[Return-on-Attention]]
            - ROA is the most relevant metric for the digital age, because it recognizes that attention is by far the scarcest resource we possess as knowledge workers.
            - ![](https://i1.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/148-149.002.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)
            - The impact or success of our work increasingly has nothing to do with how much time or money we spend on it. As industry after industry is “eaten” by software, they each become “winner take all”: a tiny minority who are able to leverage technology get nearly all the exposure and profits, while everyone else can barely make ends meet.
            - Projects have become non-linear – not simply a sum of the time and dollars spent on them, but complex emergent phenomena we can barely understand or control. Because understanding them takes just as many units of attention as acting on them, it makes more sense to plunge in with exploratory actions, instead of trying to predict what will happen in advance.
            - The question of how to manage projects is now the question of how to optimize the quantity AND quality of the attention we deploy each day. Our success depends on continually finding new sources of leverage, that is, higher and higher “returns” on this attention.
            - ### Knowledge management is project management
            - The challenge of modern work is how to create systems that free up attention, instead of consuming more of it. 
            - In other words, we need systems for managing our attention that produce value now, not eventually. We can’t be “investing” our most valuable asset today in hopes of a distant future that may never come.
            - Personal knowledge management (PKM) is the key capability in modern work, because it allows us to continuously make use of attention we’ve already deployed. But for it to be viable in the short term, PKM must also be integrated into how we manage day-to-day projects.
            - Changing how we manage projects today is how we can free up the time and attention to invest in managing our knowledge for tomorrow.

            - [[Intermediate Deliverables]]
        - #Quotes
            - In [Part 3](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/just-in-time-pm-3-the-scarcity-of-flow-cycles/), I argued that having a personal knowledge base is the linchpin of success in a creative economy.
            - A knowledge base allows you to reuse past work, draw from past experiences, share your knowledge in concrete form, and eventually, build products and services out of that knowledge.
            - This requires strategically structuring your work in the first place, as a series of what I call intermediate packets.
            - ![](https://i1.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.001.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1) 
                - {{[[DONE]]}}  reference in [[Roam for Zettlekasting]]
            - Instead of delivering one big lump of value at the very end, you stage your progress in a series of short, intense sprints, ending each one with a tangible, intermediate deliverable, like a set of notes, a brainstorm, a series of examples, an outline, a prototype, or a draft.
            - The first benefit of working this way is that you become interruption-proof.
            - Because you rarely even attempt to load the entire project into your mind all at once, there’s not much to “unload” if someone interrupts you. It’s much easier to pick up where you left off, because you’re not trying to juggle all the work-in-process in your head.
            - ![](https://i0.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.002.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)
            - Second, you have more frequent opportunities to get feedback.
            - Instead of spending weeks hammering away in isolation, only to discover that you made some mistaken assumptions, you can get feedback at each intermediate stage. You become more adaptable and more accountable, because you are performing your work in public.
            - ![](https://i2.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.003.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)
            - You will find that others give much better feedback when they are included early and the work is clearly in draft stage. If it’s too highly polished, they’ll either be afraid to critique it, or get hung up on tiny details.
            - Third, you can create value in any span of time.
            - If we see our work as creating these [[Intermediate Packets]], we can find ways to create value in any span of time, no matter how short. Productivity becomes a game of matching each available block of time (or state of mind, or mood, or energy level) with a corresponding packet that is perfectly suited to it. #[[Maker Schedule]]
            - ![](https://i0.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.004.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)
            - By always having a range of packets ready to work on, each one pre-prepared to work on at any time, you can be productive under any circumstances – waiting in the airport before a flight, the doctor’s waiting room, 15 minutes in between meetings.
            - Fourth, big projects become less intimidating.
            - Big, ambitious projects feel risky, because all the time you spend on it will feel like a waste if you don’t succeed.
            - But if your only goal is to create an intermediate packet and show it to someone — good notes on a book, a Pinterest board of design inspirations, just one module of code — then you can trick yourself into getting started. And even if that particular Big Project doesn’t pan out, you’ll still have the value of the packets at your disposal!
            - ![](https://i0.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.005.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)
            - Finally, you gain the ability to reuse previously built packets for new projects.
            - Maybe some research you did for an online marketing campaign becomes useful for a new campaign. Or some sketches that didn’t quite make it into an old design give you inspiration for a new one. Or some book notes you wrote down casually turn out to be very useful for an unforeseen challenge a year later.
            - ![](https://i0.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.006.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)
            - By incorporating existing packets into new projects, you gain the ability to deliver new projects much faster than seems possible. Eventually, you are able to deliver entire projects just by snapping together existing packets, like Lego pieces. No heavy lifts required.
            - What’s at stake here is much more than efficiency. Returning to the requirements for flow from [Part II](https://praxis.fortelabs.co/just-in-time-project-management-the-fundamentals-of-flow/), working in intermediate packets has a positive impact on all six triggers:
                - ![](https://i2.wp.com/praxis.fortelabs.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/168-175.007.jpeg?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1)
                - 1. Clear goals
                    - It’s much easier to define your goal for a short-term, intermediate packet, than for a long-term project. Shorter term goals are less likely to change, keeping you motivated.
                - 2. Immediate feedback
                    - As I discussed, it’s much easier to get feedback from others on a quick and dirty experiment than on a highly polished final product. Your efforts feel more connected to the impact you’re having on others, which also makes them more meaningful.
                - 3. Challenge-skill ratio
                    - This refers to the balance between how challenging a [[task]] is, and your skill at performing it. If it’s too hard, you’ll give up. But if it’s too easy, you’ll get bored. It’s much easier to calibrate the challenge of a project versus your skills if it’s smaller and shorter (make a 1-page brief) than if it’s a massive undertaking (launch a mobile app).
                - 4. Presence of risk
                    - As you begin to structure your work as intermediate deliverables, you begin to change the type of risk you’re exposed to. Because you know you can “freeze” any deliverable in mid-flight at any time, you no longer fear being interrupted, running out of time, or forgetting the details of what you’re working on. You substitute the risk of not delivering on something large, with the creative risks of going deeper on something small.
                - 5. Deep embodiment
                    - As you offload more and more of your abstract thinking to external tools, new bandwidth begins to open up. This leaves room for noticing your surroundings, the words and actions of others, new sensory experiences, and internal states and bodily sensations. Outsourcing your memory to software frees you up to be present in the moment. #[[Maker Schedule]]
                - 6. Rich environment
                    - The brain is the ultimate pattern recognizer: it can recognize vastly more than it can recall, so it makes sense to collect interesting patterns to help trigger memories, associations, and new ideas. Starting every project by diving into a rich media library full of pictures, drawings, diagrams, videos, sketches, and mindmaps takes advantage of what the brain engages with most naturally – visuals.
            - Breaking our work into smaller chunks directly creates the conditions for flow. Smaller packets dramatically impact not just the quantity and speed of work we can produce, and not just its quality, but the actual experienceof producing it. Work becomes more motivating, more meaningful, easier, more impactful, and more engaging. #[[Maker Schedule]]
            - Imagine if you could create real value in any span of time, under any conditions, with any level of energy or motivation. Because your productivity is not dependent on your state of mind at any given moment. It depends instead on all the knowledge and expertise you’ve acquired throughout your life, documented in a personal knowledge base.
            - This is what it looks like to create compounding gains by investing in Knowledge Capital. #[[compound interest]] #[[knowledge banking]]
