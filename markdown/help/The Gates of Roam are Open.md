Dear Potential Roamans,
    - 
    - The day many of you have been anxiously waiting for has arrived - the gates of RoamResearch.com have opened for new users again!
    - 
    - If you go to https://roamresearch.com/#/signup, you'll now be able to create an account.  After signing in, if you are ready to subscribe - you will be able to choose a plan, and upon doing so, create your own Roam "graphs".
    - 
    - Just so you're not surprised - here is the pricing page you'll see after signing in
    - 
    - ![Pricing Grid](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam%2F-zwhoxEgBy.png?alt=media&token=95f16a06-b92c-4f20-8860-f85153bae5ea)
    - 
    - But wait! There wasn't a pricing page up when you signed up right? Why are we only giving you two weeks to try Roam when earlier users got to use it for months for free?
    - 
    - I've done a terrible job communicating with folks on this list so far (we didn't even send out a confirmation email telling you you were on here!)- so I'll try to give you some context here.
    - 
**Why there is a waitlist, why you had to wait so long, and why we're charging now**
    
    First, you should know that Roam is a relatively young company, we've been working at this for years, but until a few months ago it was just the two founders - and we were mostly bootstrapping through contracts with a few research labs who wanted early access to our prototype and a voice shaping the product.
    
    About 6 or 7 weeks back, almost immediately after we made our first full-time hires, and while we were in the midst of upgrading our backend to handle what was already very rapid growth, a number of people on youtube and twitter started raving about how Roam had changed the way they organized their mind and their life -- which lead to a huge flood of new users that was more than we were ready for. 
    
    Throughout the following week, the experience of using Roam much worse became much worse for all of our users (we had multiple days where people could not use the product at all - or did not see reliable syncing of notes across devices) - and we decided that the right thing to do was to slow down our growth, put a temporary cap on new users, and make sure we could keep providing a great service for the people who need Roam the most.
    
    It's cool to be the "hot startup" and "shiny new thing" but - for myself and my co-founder Josh especially - Roam is our life's work, and we see it as at least a 50 year project. What you see today is just the foundation, and one that took us  more than 5 years of research to set. Given that, we're very ok with some of they hype dying down if it means we have a more solid base to build on, and can build a trusting long term relationship with the people who love what we've built AND believe in our vision. 
    
    This is why we're giving the best deal (most features, lowest cost) to the people who are making a 5 year commitment to us this early - as you'll see below, Roam is more than just a tool - we've got an amazing community.   
    This is why we're giving the best deal (most features, lowest cost) to the people who are making a [5 year commitment]([[Roam Believers]]) to us this early. We want to play long-term games with long term people, and reward the folks who are trusting us and helping fund the future of Roam for everyone. 
    
    Now, the good news is - since we setup this waitlist, we've successfully upgraded our backend, so we can handle a much much larger user-base. Besides infrastructure upgrades, we've also shipped a lot of product improvements, like custom themes and local only graphs for privacy focused users who have notes they don't want to store in the cloud. We're much more ready for the "big leagues" now, but we still want to be careful.  Over 50,000 of you have joined this waitlist in just the past 5 weeks, and while we're very confident we can support you - we don't want to run into a situation where we grow faster than our systems can handle again. 
    
    So, for the time being - we aren't going to have any sort of freemium plan - our pricing is going to be a bit more expensive than most "productivity tools" you might be used to - and we won't be promising you that we'll meet all the expectations you might have if you're coming from other tools that have been around for ages - like Evernote or OneNote.
    
    We know this will turn away some of the people who are just lightly curious what all the hype is about - but as you'll if you keep reading - we hope things like the [[Roam Scholars]] program don't turn away folks who are really excited to learn the power of the tool, but don't currently have the financial means to afford it.

**Some Warnings**
    - Since we're turning on payments - it's totally reasonable for you to expect more from us than a startup with a free beta. I want to be clear up front about some places we might fall short of those expectations.
    - **1. There are definitely still going to be occasional bugs.  **
        - For example - we have 7 people in our shared team Roam right now, and every week or so we get a synching error where one of our teams notes end up moved to the wrong place.  In just the past few days, we heard from one user who found that images they uploaded weren't rendering, and another whose public read-only graph had suddenly become publicly editable. Earlier today, when I pushed out the code to allow new users to pay and start creating graphs, the first 10 or so users to try couldn't because of an error I let slide to production. (fixed before writing this email)
        - 
        - We do our best to fix bugs as soon as we find them, and to guarantee uptime as much as possible, but the team is only 6 people right now - most of them relatively new. We try to ship code quickly, and sometimes there are mistakes.  We haven't fully built out a customer support team (we will be hiring for that and other roles soon)- but if you have trouble it might take us a while to get to you.
    - **2. We don't have all the bells and whistles you might expect from a hyped-up app. **
        - We still don't have a mobile app (though there are some really talented folks working on an unoffical app based on our upcoming API), and if you want a web-clipper for collecting highlights, you'll have to use one of the Chrome Extensions built by one of the passionate community of roam users that call themselves the #roamcult. The tool also isn't the most beautifully designed - but fortunately - if you're willing to put in a little effort, there are now a ton of much nicer themes for Roam that have built by our community. 
    - **3. We don't have the easiest on-boarding to help you discover all the features of Roam or the ways they can help you**
        - For some people - the idea of being able to easily find old notes, remix your ideas, and build simple systems for organizing all your projects and thoughts makes a bunch of sense immediately. For some people, as soon as they see it, they know Roam is something they've been waiting for for decades. You might be one of them.  For others, it sometimes takes a few hours of watching youtube videos, chatting with other users, and experimenting before Roam really "clicks."  Again, this is a place where #roamcult has done far more to support each other than we could as a team - and we highly recommend checking out the great courses, articles and demo videos they've created -- many of which you can find on roambrain.com or roamtips.com (both sites made by passionate users).
        - 
        - If you try Roam out, and find yourself confused and underwhelmed with what all the buzz has been about - that's totally OK!  Roam is meant to be a new way of organizing thoughts that more naturally fits your brain (it actually builds on some ideas from back before the web). Our goal is to make a medium for thinking in that helps you solve problems and have insights you otherwise wouldn't have. For many of our users Roam already it already is that -- but it's still very early days for us, and the tool definitely still has a bit of a learning curve. If we're not for you today, I hope you don't decide to write us off forever.
        - 
**Finally - a few final words on pricing.**  
    - Long term, our goal has always been to be more than just a personal tool for notes or tasks - from day one our mission has been to change how people learn and think together, to create a new medium for collaborative discovery and problem solving. 
    - 
    - Roam __is__ more expensive than many other "software as a service apps" you might have looked into, but this isn't because we only care about helping rich people or folks in developed countries.  We're expensive because we know that for the folks who really get into Roam, we deliver a LOT more value than $15/month, and because we want to build a stable economic foundation so that we aren't always chasing VC cash. 
    - 
    - We want to have a solid enough business that we can hire the best people in the world to solve the problems that we think are critical to building a more intelligent, creative, and cooperative future, and we want to keep our focus on the long term, not the next boom and bust economic cycle. We also know that many people just aren't going to ready for Roam yet - and until word spreads, habits change, and our product matures - we're going to have to build that foundation on a user-base that is a quite a bit smaller than other companies you might compare us with - like Notion or Evernote.
    - 
    - That said - we are committed to trying to make Roam as affordable as possible for folks who desperately want to use all the power that this new kind of thinking tool offers.  To keep Roam affordable for folks who need it, we're launching - along with pricing - a Roam Scholars program, where Roamans for whom $15/month would be a serious financial burden can get a heavily subsidized plan. So - If you need help to be able to afford Roam - PLEASE just ask. We don't want to keep you out because of cost. 
    - 
    - If on the other hand, you aren't strapped for cash, but just don't think there is any way a "note taking app" could possibly be worth more to you than a Netflix subscription - or if you think there is just no way this tool could be 3x more useful to you than something else that's offered for free -- we'd just ask you to poke around the #roamcult hashtag on twitter, or ask some folks in our community who've learned the ins and outs of Roam what they think. If it still isn't right now you, we hope you come back later when it is -- we do plan to roll out other pricing tiers in the future. 
    -  
    - Finally - if all of this is totally new to you - and you've only heard a few things about Roam, or haven't heard anything at all - WELCOME - I can't believe you read this far.  If you're curious about our company, who we are, how we got here, and where we're going - I recommend you check out this interview I did with Kevin Rose a few months ago, or this one with Tiago Forte (the "productivity guru", and greatest frenemy of Roam who 1/2 of you preferred to be your guide than a Magical Trash Panda -- poor choice! -- raccoons are far more resourceful than you realize!)
    - 
    - Thank you for your interest in Roam, and for waiting so patiently (or impatiently) for access. 
    - 
    - I hope you will find RoamResearch to be (if not today, then in the not very distant future) all you hoped for and more. I hope you will join us in making it that. 
 
Much Love 

Conor
