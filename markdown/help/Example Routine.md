    - This note would get pinned to the right sidebar with the Star symbol at the top right of each page ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2FkLGehFS0Ne?alt=media&token=87d44cb1-09f8-4ae3-b83c-40ef4e682a66) 
    - each day open it, and copy/paste the contents into your daily notes
    - The advantage of using [[Bidirectional Links]] or [[Attributes in Roam]] for these repeating tasks that you're copy/pasting in each day is that you can click on any of those particular links, and get a sense of which day's you've completed them - and start to see trends across days based on notes that you took
