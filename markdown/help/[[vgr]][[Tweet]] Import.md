        - I checked again in case I was mistaken. I wasn’t. At least on safari/iPad when you log in a second time, there is no option to skip giving permissions like on first sign up. There is also no non-google authentication. If you back out, auth just fails. Seriously @lunchclubai 🤬 https://t.co/ZGmKs6p4QM https://t.co/Vhc2g4iA0p

        - @joeld @DomIrigaray Yeah I don't find that kind of retconning useful, but Girard has clearly been actionable to Thiel and those influenced by him at least, as is clear from the specifics of things he's done (go after Gawker, support Trump, fund various subcultures, hereticon etc)

        - There's a weird horseshoe theory type effect between extreme autodidacts who have never experienced institutionalized academia and extreme Straussians within the academy (rare outside of specific disciplines like economics or political science). Both have this kind of reaction.

        - @harmonylion1 @knovigator I think it reproduces a bias I had in my old similar product, trailmeme... it undervalues fragmentary internally generated thoughts, treating them mostly as annotations to external discoveries. This works for hedgehog minds, where all the annotations come from a single headspace.

        - @harmonylion1 @knovigator I think I glanced at it when you or someone else flagged it for me before, but it doesn't quite hit the sweet spot for me. The construct of 'quests' and search-based exploration as the core experience aren't quite good fits for how I think.

        - @cigardubey I've never had a consistent system for &gt; 2-3 years. I wrote this based on the setup I had during my postdoc which was 100% paper. Most recently, pre-Roam, it's been a mix of scrivener, scapple, email, workflowy, iPad notebooks, paper notebooks 😫 https://t.co/eISzGg1CcD
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203754739621433345
        - @Conaw [[@RoamResearch]] I'm guessing this is already on your roadmap, but the solution is permission buckets, where everything tagged "multitemporality book" could be given the same permission settings, but with people with access to multiple projects, crosslinks and transclusions still work.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203753490696167424
        - @Conaw [[@RoamResearch]] But the permissions thing is a good one and doesn't mess with the hedgehog second brain model. I might want to share my book project notes with Alice but not Bob, my science fiction novel attempt with Bob but not Alice, and my personal notes with my wife but no outsiders.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203753102613999616
        - @Conaw [[@RoamResearch]] The branding reason I think is a possibly bad one because it creates a tradeoff with the hedgehoggy-second-brain model, which makes me think you should be cautious about building out in the direction of highly polished publishing media with skinning, logos, domain names etc
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203752732152094720
        - @Conaw [[@RoamResearch]] One of the things you're going to run into is people wanting to separate out projects. Currently I'm using it only for 1 project, and I see two different reasons for wanting separate ones: separate "branding" for public things and separate permissions.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203752363053350912
        - @francisregan [[@RoamResearch]] From my limited use of OneNote and Evernote they’re both a generation too primitive and optimized fir a different style of thinking so they’re not on this spectrum.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203747608516157445
        - So a tool with a 2h minimum can sustain a 10x bigger positive-rate knowledge base with the same budget of people/money than a 4h minimum. I suspect for Roam, a very suitable project may get it down to minutes, and for a typical project, maybe 30min.

Something like that.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203747151425064960
    - 
        - My suspicion is, a good KPI for a knowledge tool is minimum threshold of time required to make a negentropic update to it, with every halving of the threshold increasing its capacity to hold positive-interest-rate knowledge repos by an order of magnitude.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203746592617947136
        - This btw is the maker time/manager time problem pg wrote about. Making needs 4 hour chunks because anything less tends to increase entropy rather than decrease it in any non-trivial knowledge work project. So anything that lowers that lower limit is a big win.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203745235534147584
        - By contrast in weaker media, I have to be in high energy, direct focus headspace, having warmed up around 30 minutes to get situation awareness around the whole project. Only then can I reliably lower entropy and turn interest rate positive. Roam lowers threshold to 10% of that.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203744716820369408
        - In practice, I’m finding now that when I have a new nugget to add, from whatever headspace I’m in (working, at the gym, random thought during in a meeting, half-asleep thought in bed), I can always make a quick judgment  of approximately where a thought belongs, and put it there.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203743475671285762
        - Compare for instance Wikipedia (~100s-1000s unpaid) or Stanford Encyclopedia or Wolfram Mathworld (single digits -100s, but paid, directly it indirectly).

This is probably because Roam allows one mind to effectively act as many (Fox &gt; Hedgehog)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203742941929279489
        - So a good measure of the technical sophistication of a medium is to measure the number of people (eyeballs) and money (how much they’re paid) required to sustain a positive interest rate. I think Roam reduces both to the limit: 1 person and self-funded hobby time.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203742277773885440
        - Anytime I’ve seen a positive-interest-rate knowledge repo, it’s because many people were resurfacing bits and pieces at random and making point improvements. So the only known solution to date for positive interest rate has been to collectivize and socialize the prosthetic memory
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203741612007931904
        - In the past most such efforts have failed because they relied on automation to try and keep entropy at bay, which sort of works weakly with relative legible and structured information. But for more squishy information, the only thing that works is a “many eyeballs” process.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203741098230743040
        - Knowledge generally depreciates, and a holy grail of knowledge modeling and capture for a long time has been to reverse the default negative interest rate it accrues and turn it positive. There was a “knowledge banking” project at Xerox back in the day that aimed at this for eg.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203740466472091650
        - The thing is, recall is a virtuous cycle. The better a medium supports recall, the easier it is to attach new information in the right places. Which makes recall even easier. And the easier it is to add content, the faster this process snowballs. So a compound interest effect.

        - Gonna start documenting subtle features here. First up: Roam is probably the most efficient prosthetic memory I’ve used, as in, creating efficient recall of thoughts I’ve already thunk and written up. A killer feature when you’ve written as much as I have (good or bad).

        - @Wit_recycler not quite... since both source and destination are wordpress, I imported the blog posts and pages directly into the ribbonfarm site, so it's not a directory. All the old posts are now just posts on ribbonfarm with the domain name changed.

        - @Wit_recycler do you mean where the domains are registered (namecheap) or where the sites are hosted currently (wpengine)? I imagine the rewrite rule is at the host level, and at the registrar level the domain itself is redirected to the other domain?

        - @mrgunn Zappos is an excellent example because internally, they are NOT like Away. They really work to create a good employee experience too. It's mostly low-wage customer service jobs, but they seem kinda happy with the carnivalesque internal culture and aren't driven like slaves.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203386560915243009
        - Very few products in traditional marketing unironically positioned themselves as identitycore products. Cars perhaps. Education (college). Healthcare and insurance products.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203386241246347264
        - When you see ads for (for eg) coca-cola or pringles, it is clear that the marketers understand this isn't your life, it's a snack. The lifestyle narratives presented in commercials has a subtext of cheerful irony/absurdity. This is missing in DTC ads I see on Facebook.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203385898865315840
        - There is something weird about the v-commerce/DTC world, in that they seem to unironically think customer identities are shaped by a single product (t-shirt, razors, shorts, luggage, backpacks, water bottles)... this is a mistake old-school marketing never made.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203385591725010945
        - If you sell only one non-life-or-death product or service, chances that your customer's whole-life holistic identity is coupled to consuming your product is zero. There is no point being obsessed with a narrow aspect of someone's life that they themselves are not.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203385326946775040
    - 
        - For the latter, two ways to test if your business qualifies. You might either sell so many things "share of wallet" is the best metric (Amazon, Walmart) OR you touch such a broad swathe of the information the customer consumes you can shape their mind (Facebook, Twitter)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203384859932028928
        - I think the two situations in which "customer obsession" is a meaningful corporate value are:

a) life or death matters are involved

b) you see enough sides of a customer's life that the internal model is not a one-product cartoon (ie all the broad tech platforms)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203384374386806784
        - Finally read the Away story. My main reaction was: I understand this mindset for running a space mission or an ER during a crisis... but for customers of... overrated luggage?

Not all customers deserve customer obsession as a corporate value
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203375939364646912
        - something lost in the Away situation is: it's fucking luggage. these god damn monsters are giving people panic attacks over premium-mediocre suitcases. eat the fucking rich

        - Rationalist theories that suppose (explicitly or implicitly) that our activities derive from chains of inference can’t be true. Neurons are much too slow for that.

        - Research on temporality is shaped by the gravity field of a few big fat books:

J. T. Fraser’s Time: the Familiar Stranger
Proust’s In Search of Lost Time
The Einstein-Bergson debate (an event with a fat literature attached)
David Landes’ Revolution in Time
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203014093524754433
        - Still, this is hard when a subject is dominated by gravity field of big fat books. It’s like operating in Jupiter orbit. Engineering research is like the asteroid belt. Mostly papers. If it’s a big fat book, it’s already a textbook in civilized core, not part of the frontier.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203013023809429504
        - The strategic trick is realizing that the 3-5 you go deep on are almost certainly NOT going to be the consensus seminal references in the field. That’s a recipe for boring incrementalism. You get interesting results by putting weird, unexpected obscure picks in your top 5.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1203012125922213889
        - During my PhD my advisor or somebody offered a wise heuristic: for every 100 references you collect (and 100 is the minimum to claim mastery of a subject) and grok the basic point of, you actually shallow read maybe 10, and deep read maybe 3-5.

        - This is a deep psychological risk a lot of long-term employees don’t notice till it’s too late. Work is the biggest part of identity for people who must work for a living. Not family or hobbies. If the employer is dying, you’re dying with it unless you do something about it.

        - A “vulture” in this situation is an aggressive PE type operator that aims to make the harvesting maximally efficient.  Running faster than natural decline curve to get traction and steering authority over process. Like how you have to accelerate into a turn for control sometimes.

        - If you work for a company that’s harvesting a market in terminal decline rather than pioneering, growing, or sustaining one, by default you’ll be a dead player. To come alive again, you have to get in on a disruption story (externally or internally) or turn into a proper vulture.

A theatrically exaggerated statement is hyperbole

A statement that borders on hyperbole is a parabole 

If it is opaque without being exaggerated it is elliptical

        - “Doing science” is developing and exercising judgment about rules.

Do the rules extend beyond the justifiable? Do they not formalize enough of what is justifiable? Does it apply here? Should it be broken there?

Corner cases make bad law, but they make for  good science.

        - Where “lawyer” can be loosely construed as any profession dedicated to upholding systems of rules, whether theological, monarchical, constitutional, or ideological in origin. There may be lip service to the phenomenology the rules are “about” but internal consistency is central
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1202650157566722048
        - A good definition of science is: keeping bureaucratic epistemology in check. We’re an unchecked proceduralist species. Without rules about how to make rules we tend to get on runaway rule-making binges and choking ourselves to death.

The opposite of “scientist” is “lawyer”

        - We’re still collectively free-riding on a 150-year old “steal” — burning our very distant ancestors for fun and profit. The hard workers get a bit more of the fossil fuel pie for a lot higher effort.

        - @Aelkus It’s a bit like ceremonial language around “our troops.”

If you believe war and military functions in society are basically a pragmatic necessity, you say “thank you for your service” an move on, leaving larger questions of militarism and futile/bad wars to other conversations.

        - Most people are not lazy enough. The kind of relentlessly effortful living conservatives love to preach is unnatural except perhaps for hummingbirds. Half of survival of the fittest is the patience to wait for the steals and deals and moments of unreasonable leverage.

        - @Aelkus Sure. I’m giving the steelman version of the doerist argument the benefit of the doubt and assuming an opt-in comparison set for whom the exhortation would not be situationally unreasonable. My point is, choosing not to hustle is a valid life choice requiring no justification.

        - Exhortation is not inspiration. Exhortation is the in-group amplifier drug among already-aligned and activated doers.

For the inertial out-group the change-seeking tribe wants to mobilize, the key to motivation is creating disequilibrium.

        - Dragging your feet and rolling your eyes is a more potent mode of agency than doerists like to admit, which is why it can be infuriating to well-intentioned people trying to cause positive change. The trick to motivation is to drop the “positive” and just drive change.

But it has to be genuinely arbitrary, without even a whiff of justification. So billionaires as de facto nobility doesn’t work, no matter what Americans think. It’s not arbitrary enough.

        - Kidding aside, while the virtues of a monarchy are kinda theoretical and depend on the reality distortion field of a fragile bit of magical thinking, hereditary nobility has some interesting properties (good or bad) that don’t seem to exist in technocratic institutionalism.

        - I’ve never liked using my name as a brand, but apparently this is the default for most new platforms. This is probably twitter’s best feature, that they don’t insist on integrating everything around a single personal identity.

Top 1% is apparently 4 million. So millionaire works.

Threshold for top 0.01% is apparently $111 million. I’m guessing 0.1% is like 10-20 million.

        - @rob_knight @tomcritchlow I’d love that tbh. Working on it. Blogchains started out with a 300 word block size but I found myself routinely creeping up to 1000 or 2000.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1200117512425230336
        - The blogchain concept is something like an attempt to jury-rig an explicit graph structure as @tomcritchlow pointed out yesterday, but still with temporality as strictly dominant organizing principle. The basic DAG must be an approximate partial temporal order. Cycles are add-ons

        - I think codebase evolution on git has a similar natural structure. The “diff” maps to the “post” and “parent version” to “backlink”

        - The key tension in a blog is between the irreversibility of the log stream in time and the evolving internal reference structure. There is a natural asymmetry as old posts don’t get updated to point to future posts that reference them.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199874499522396160
        - Everybody was all bullish on ideologies a few years back, and many people wanted to work on them, innovate on them, etc. Now everybody is sick of them, and tries or pretends to be above them. But they aren’t going anywhere. Good time to invest actually.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199872674173816833
        - @celestialboon This is a meaningless criticism by a self-important mystic. Ideology is just a given of human behavior that manifests under certain conditions. Calling it poisonous is like calling gravity poisonous or hair poisonous.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199871724692443136
        - If you ditch ideology, you’ll at least find someone to hold accountable within your means. Not vote for them, not work with them, not buy their stuff etc. This is what cancel culture clumsily tries to do, except via mob judgment contagion rather than actual distributed judgment.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199871217282338816
        - Trick to breaking out of these patterns is to ignore analyses that do not center specific behaviors of named people.

When you do that, it will turn into a game of no-true-Scotsman. Pick 2 of 3: a name, an ideology, responsibility for a problem
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199870195516329987
        - @Aelkus That’s not a problem, it’s a feature.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199868709017288704
        - Note what happens in such discourses. Specific problems are plausibly everybody’s fault and therefore nobody’s fault.

Nobody has to change behavior, everybody gets to preach at everybody else, recommending specific moral evolutions to them from vice to virtue.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199867035175374850
        - Ideology, like love, means never having to say you’re sorry.
 
Example: when market failures happen through distortions/ externalities, capitalists blame state institutions, libertarians blame cronyism, socialists blame greedy individualism. Nobody has to accept any blame.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199866447087824896
        - This intersubjective approach to ideological self-definition is pragmatic, operationalizes and weaponizes attribution error at scale, successfully casts all failures as aberrations caused by the vices of others, and ensures you never have to admit you’re wrong about anything.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199865608696819712
        - Example 2, (socialism, capitalism), (socialism, libertarianism)

X1: compassion, Y1: greed
X2: community, Y2: selfishness

Example 3 (libertarianism, socialism), (libertarian, capitalism*)

X1: individualism, Y1: bureaucracy
X2: innovation, Y2: cronyism

* capitalism in practice
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199865066142584833
        - Example: some degree of free-riding is an obviously likely in a welfare state, so that incentive becomes the definition of socialism. Their internal justifications (eg compassion) can be rejected as hypocrisy. But their own behavior is explained by “efficient market” not “greed”.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199864095933026304
        - This is a neat arrangement because what it does is define the ideology via arguments of convenience against the specific weaknesses of competitors, based on their visible incentives while explaining their iwn behavior in terms of reasonable necessity rather than incentives.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199863369643122688
        - Point is, no ideology is ever characterized from first principles in practice. People who try to do that are (correctly) dismissed as impractical fundamentalists. An  ideology only exists as a set of pairwise defenses of solipsistic self-certainty against *specific* competitors.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199862624545984512
        - Example, for (capitalism, socialism), (capitalism, libertarianism) we get

X1: market
Y1: lazy free-riding

X2: efficiencies of scale
Y2: naïveté of small-scale/decentralized idealism
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199861741942738945
        - There is no consensus external view because the outside-in views do not harmonize. So the choice for an insider is to believe in either a solipsistic and self-serving self-image or an incoherent union of outside-in critical moral judgments that can be dismissed as incoherent.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199861144552275968
        - So an ideology is characterized by a set of statements asserting pairwise relations of the form:

“My foundation is this proven mechanism X that works, your foundation is this vice Y you refuse to trade for a virtue” 

The solipsistic self-image is ((X1, Y1), (X2, Y2),...)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199860368924823552
        - Had a little thought. We tend to characterize ideologies in internal (“subjective”) or external (“objective”) terms, but in practice work with them in intersubjective ways, where the first class citizen is the directed ideology pair like (capitalism, communism).

W = under the API labor with rewards and dignity of industrial work and the self-determination and flexibility of digital.

P = over-the-API work to turn capital into returns for  C, more humane work for W

        - The on,y way out is to abandon these broad class divisions entirely and seed very small scale W+P+C coalitions that both work and capture the imagination in a way that creates a *new* basis for trust.

        - All three are under different patterns of identity stress and economic stress (yes even the capitalists; the r&gt;g theater does not run itself) that they need help from the other two to solve but there is so little trust no broad alliances are possible. Only uneasy splintering.

W+P&gt;C (A New Hope, Warren, Sanders, Biden)
C+P&gt;W (Bloomberg, Harris.... Empire Strikes Back, )
W+C&gt;P (Trump re-elected)

None of these work, so likely outcome is incumbency win for Trump.

        - One solution: run for POTUS on campaign promise of a Purge, but where elites get free guns, and if they survive, they get UBI and climate action. The masses get to mount the heads of any elites they take down on spikes. 0.1% capital winners will be parked in orbit during Purge
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199827210569281536
        - So on the narrow question of winning POTUS, the right candidate would be a mix of Obama and Trump: promise hope to the elites and the chance to bloody a few noses to the laboring class. The paradox being they want to bloody the noses of the class looking for hope.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1199826500121321475
        - I think the tldr is: the laboring class is politically still potent but economically a deadweight loss and everybody (including they themselves) knows it and has acknowledged it. The professional class still thinks it has a shot at resurrection.

        - @tomcritchlow @iChris Really, that's what you're talking about Tom. My elderblogging personal phase just happens to synchronize with the elder stage of the medium itself. Of the 2 dynamics (me getting old, blogging getting disrupted by threading), the latter is the more important one obviously.

        - @tomcritchlow @iChris Agreed. Substack is a point solution for harvesting the end-of-life blog market into the email ecosystem, which seems more robust/long-lived. It is less a successor to blogging than a sort of upmarket retreat for blogging being disrupted by threaded open media

        - @bhudgeons @TaylorPearsonMe @artofgig Example if you have a volatile supply of apples and no cold storage:

0-1 apple/week = leveraged use as a salad accent
2-5 apples/week = just eat’em
5-15 apples = learn recipes for pies, cider, preserves, apple sauce, wine, etc, make as needed

$ is a bit more complex than apples

        - We already live in the highest maintenance society ever, almost entirely due to one technology: TV. Every day a big chunk of humans watch 2-4 hours of life from a high-interestingness/low-maintenance fictional metaverse, go to bed for a bit, and then do 8h maintenance work
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196699148247953409
        - Maybe there’s an alternative conception of AI as SM. Self-maintaining systems. IBM at one point was trying something stuffily named autonomic computing that was sorta this idea. Forget intelligence and recursive self-improvement. You invent self-maintenance and you’re kinda done.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196697610481856512
        - Natural evolution tends to either automate maintenance needs or throw a closed fun loop around them. We mostly throw an open bureaucratic loop at them and then try to motivate with extrinsic carrots/sticks. Blech.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196691111575572480
        - “Modern” epochs begin when there is enough technological surplus to systematically buy present conveniences at the cost of future maintenance debt. They end when we declare maintenance bankruptcy.

Not saying this is a good thing. It’s just who we are as a species.

        - There’s that theory of collapse that says societies collapse when they get too complex. Too complex = demands more maintenance than humans can endure.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196689777388445696
        - There’s a slowly developing high-minded ideology around valorizing maintenance. I’m going to bet it will fail. Humans never step up to the ennobling demands of a high-maintenance world, we tend to blow it up so it’s either more interesting or lower maintenance
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196689493887049728
        - Maintenance is not just boring, it is metaboring

Boring is when you change the channel because a dull show on

Metaboring is the realization that there’s nothing good on TV and you have to turn it off and do something else for a bit

Maintenance is metaboringness for life itself

That’s actually what’s kinda slowly choking traditional research (citation numbers, impact factors, patent counts, ROI mentality). I’m thinking more a kind of disciplined narrative-driven visionary romanticism.

        - @Meaningness But while they have the marketing instincts the old-school administrator types didn't, they generally lack the technical literacy required to administer advanced stuff wisely once it is in motion, and various kinds of review/monitoring disciplines.

        - @Meaningness They are the crowdfunding equivalent of NSF-whisperers... instead of being good at working funding agency directors/commissions and knowing the game of responding to RFPs, they are crowd-whisperers, who know how to clickbait funding out of the masses.

        - @Meaningness Yeah, it would take people with imagination stepping off the traditional path sufficiently early, and updating skillset. The closest to this class I've seen starting to emerge is "Kickstarter agents" (basically specialists in running kickstarter campaigns).

        - @Meaningness Like, I stepped off a career path in industrial R&amp;D that would have gone from program management to lab management. It simply did not look like fun compared.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196494555350065153
        - @Meaningness A basic problem is lack of administrative energy. Research requires enlightened administration more than most demanding human activities. Kinda like people on spacewalks or deep-sea dives need a mission control partner at safer loci. This is a thankless task few want to do.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196493791168909312
        - @Meaningness Probably not anytime soon, and the fault is probably more on our side as wannabe beneficiaries of such a system as much as those with capital to deploy. There is a significant lack of imagination and energy on both sides of the capital supply/demand equation.

        - This does not of course preclude belief in specific superstitious ideas and conspiracy theories, but the general, default epistemology is not magical thinking for most people. It is simply a kind of rational laziness that can look like it under certain behavioral lenses.

        - Basically, this so-called postmodern peasant is simply someone who has some mix of laziness, indifference, and lack of curiosity about, how modern technology works, and a rational assessment that they're probably not smart enough to understand most of it.

        - If you've actually met people with literalist magical thinking beliefs, there is no way you'd be confused about this. There's no way my ironic messing around with horoscopes is anything like my grandparents sincere reliance on horoscopes for major life decisions.

        - Believing in this kind of neo-medievalist reading of the modern human condition is a bit like believing visitors to Disneyland actually believe in fairies and princesses and large anthropomorphic rodents named Mickey, just because they might wear some larping costumes.

        - A big tell is that genuine magical beliefs induce uncritical reverence for wielders of esoteric knowledge. Far from being treated as Merlins, the literate magicians of postmodernity are largely treated with something between patronizing contempt and resentful anger.

        - It takes weird contortions to pretend that these modes are in like the medieval ones they superficially resemble. Sure, some of our interactions with technology have the structure and appearance of magical incantations and such, and things like Kek try to kayfabe the gap.

        - There is definitely something going on here, and I'm participating (cf: my new tagline this year of "constructions in magical thinking" and my recent interest in things like astrology and tarot). But naive retreat to pre-modern stances and modes is not what's going on.

        - If the university research world is concerned about competition from a parallel independent research world catalyzed by private funding and alternate norms, one that currently has vanishingly tiny funding (mostly self-funding) compared to their world, you have to wonder: why?

        - It’s a ritual in the university world to whine about how research funding is under threat. But from the outside, people would correctly conclude that the system has near-monopolistic access to a vast public funding budget. And my proposal doesn’t even envision touching that.

        - @DanielWhiteson It’s a deliberately focused comparison on the startup phase that allow research careers to be bootstrapped. I am aware that total funding is vastly larger. I am not suggesting undermining the university system, merely providing an alternative to it for independent researchers.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1196103902313119746
    - 
        - Clarification: I only considered CAREER grants rather than the vastly larger total funding pie because bootstrapping the”startup” phase is the hardest part of research. My speculative assumption is that if that’s solved, enough will succeed that larger pie will emerge organically https://t.co/zXFRJ8NUOZ

        - Tweeting unironically about serious topics is so off-brand for me now I barely recognize myself when I do it.

There’s a few topics I feel uniquely qualified to seriouspost publicly about though. A good change of pace even if nobody who matters listens. 

Now back to shitposting.

        - @Noahpinion I predict they will not be attempted so your prediction is moot 😆
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195963058608209920
        - I was very lucky btw, to have so many options, and a generally cheerful and positive mindset exiting academia, feeling good about myself and my choices. The university system traumatizes and destroys 4-5 people for every 1 it shapes positively. It’s ugly out there.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195958127725694976
        - My own future ambitions beyond indie writing and publishing are pretty modest, so I can self-fund most things I care to research on the margins of non-research stuff and don’t need anyone besides me to care about outcomes. No desire to shoot for John Carmack level goals.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195956485957636096
        - * SBIR and STTR, for those unfamiliar with it, is a rather sorry-ass federal small business innovation grants program that in theory should sustain indie research, but in practice ends up subsidizing military-industry complex subcontracting layer
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195955265369079808
        - Would have been nice to have this option in 2006 though, when my choices were: second postdoc, govt lab, industry, a sketchy faculty position offer I didn’t like, and SBIR grinding. I created blogger-consultant option for myself ~2007 and that worked well for me but doesn’t scale
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195954678476886017
        - Personally I’m aged out of directly benefiting from this kind of infrastructure and am not missionary enough to try and lead an effort to make it happen for others.

Happy to play wingman to anyone with the hustle and network to try though. I’ve thought this through a lot 🙂
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195954070512488448
        - There’s probably a way this solves the adjunct crisis too, but I’ll leave that for another day (it’s an overlapping population but not coextensive with indie research target population... maybe 30% overlap)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195952375367778304
        - In this picture the traditional university doesn’t get disrupted so much as have its role refactored into a sort of infrastructure cloud provisioning role. 

I’d expect much of this sort of thing to happen in university ecosystems actually.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195952158299971585
        - What’s the alternative? The innovation economy finally kills the dying golden goose for the last few golden eggs, and enters a late stage fraud economy competing with NIMBY grifters in decaying urban cores. Stockbuybackitis infects SV too. The music stops.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195950117087432704
        - Income-share education models already exist and offer a competitive alternative to the teaching function of universities and get out of the unsustainable student debt balloon. 

R&amp;D can be unbundled too.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195949343817134080
        - I’d revamp publishing, peer review models, etc, as well, since the model that exists is failing even for university research (hence reproducibility crisis, impact factor gaming, purely cronyism predatory journal empires etc) but that’s a secondary mechanism design problem.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195948613865623552
        - I bet every top 5 VC,  PE, and Big Tech firm could each sustain 20% NSF CAREER type indie research network, 3x-ing total R&amp;D bandwidth of the US. 

With expectations of open source/license output. Restock the commons without need for big 60s/70s style government programs.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195947272963383298
        - I think the R&amp;D loop can be closed with tech wealth and investment capital. Universities can be unbundled. There’s no good reason to keep teaching, research, and service in the same costly brick and mortar bundle anymore.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195945989468647431
        - Now that model is struggling, I have to wonder why huge capital stocks created from that legacy investment aren’t being plowed back into the head of the funnel. 

Possibly SV has gotten used to easy private wealth building off of publicly funded feedstock.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195945304320667648
        - The research university model worked well for about 60 years after WW2. It supplied both the talent and the IP feedstock (not just STEM, humanities/liberal arts as well) to drive American business growth an leadership. Z

Basically free in-kind money for the innovation economy.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195944349537718273
        - Basically there’s a bullshit R&amp;D funnel argument that people trot out to explain slowing of new business formation and general innovation stagnation/falling business dynamism (similar to the one around diversity in tech hiring).
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195943797168820225
        - And indie research would dispense with indirect cost support (~50% overhead charge that research universities typically charge agencies to pay for brick-and-mortar infrastructure, a big innovation in its time, due to Vannevar Bush).
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195942913017954306
        - SV people tend to be free market ideologues, yet their free market idealism mysteriously vanishes when talking about this stuff. SoftBank alone could fund something like this probably.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195942373693378560
        - I’m making this arithmetic comparison because SV investors sometimes act like basic research is entirely out of their reach and all they can do is draft off of output of big government R&amp;D programs running over decades. This is just not true anymore.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195940842973777920
        - Let’s look at Silicon Valley.  Last I checked, Series A, B, C, and D rounds are ~10 million, 20mm, 50mm, 100mm. Might be off by a bit.

So... doubling research capacity of entire university system = 20 As, 10 Bs, 4 Cs, or 2 Ds.

Entirely within the capacity of SV capital market

        - At grad student stipend level, you’re talking about a quarter that. 25k/year. So you could support about 1200 grad student level researchers for the same amount. So $19- million gets you somewhere between 300 to 1200 bets on independent researchers. Now who can afford that?
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195939211536289792
        - A subset of ~20 get PECASE awards which push up the 100k to 500k/yr, sp that’s another 40 million. This 190 million basically supports 300 new faculty every year which I think is approximately ALL new faculty in say the top 25-30 universities.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195938439910154245
        - On one extreme you can think UBI, which is roughly ~ early grad student level $. 

On the other extreme, you could think of early career faculty grants.

An NSF CAREER grant is 100k/year for 5 yrs, and in 2018, about 150 million was disbursed or about 300.

        - One thing I probably could do is raise funding for a small research institution/lab working on problems in the 6-8 range. Maybe 4-5 staff. The thing is I don’t want to run a research org, which is an entirely different interest/ambition than doing research. It takes a COO type.

        - Many things get called “research” and a lot of ego-sensitivity gets attached to it. I think of it mainly in terms of (high risk of no valuable output)*(high ratio of invisible to visible output)*(high time demands). Let me try to pseudo-quantify this and take the ego element out:
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195833555139477504

        - @edsaperia @kevinmarks @nwspk Being first/original on a topic is not actually a primary motivation in research for most researchers in my experience. Interestingness is the primary driver. Nobody picks a problem simply because it’s at the intersection of fundable by a model and unworked-on.

        - @EvanSandhoefner It’s not a “cost”, it’s an incompatibility. You don’t get to decide to treat it as a cost for arbitrary projects, only ones that are first compatible structurally with that model. There’s no meaningful way to spin most things in crowd-pleasing ways.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195828857565138944
        - A basic thing many fans of crowdfunding seem to be blind to is that crowdfunding = crowdpleasing.

I’ve never done crowdfunding because I’ve never yet had a crowdpleasing idea.

Low-unit-cost, high-volume consumer products like my ebooks and newsletter aren’t crowd funding
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195824078524805126
        - Writing grant proposals to satisfy a few bureaucrats is already enough of a mismatch to research personalities. Crowd-pleasing requires 10x that painful mismatch.

        - A more basic problem with kickstarter type ideas is that anyone good at creating the buzz and hype for that is almost by definition going to be bad at R&amp;D and vice versa. Content mismatch aside.

        - The topic I wanted to research, and got about 1/3 the way through, was institution building in the Great Weirding. It’s the sort of thing that’s not a natural fit for any corporate funding source.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195818881249472512
        - A good public example: Breaking Smart S2 was a medium-depth research project I thought I could sustain on my own (a16z supported S1). I gave up looking for funding after a couple of half-hearted pitches to orgs I thought might be a fit for the topic.

        - Ironically, most modern tenured faculty don’t get to do much R&amp;D either, at least in STEM. They’re too busy fund-raising. They’re more like angel investors and board advisors to grad students and postdocs. Humanities and social sciences may perhaps be better, I don’t know.

        - I’m on a year-long fellowship right now, and this is partly what has made me admit the conceit in the “indie researcher” self-label. I’m doing this sort of thinking for the first time since ~2006 or so (the year I last submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed journal). https://t.co/5kK51vHuQ9

Slim pickings
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195807408032899072
        - I find that autodidacts who haven’t experienced institutional R&amp;D environments have a self-congratulatory low threshold for what they count as research. It’s a bit like vanity publishing or fan fiction. This mismatch doesn’t exist as much in indie art, consulting, game dev etc
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195806949893267456
        - Note #3

Learning projects to prepare to go deep on a subject are not research even if it feels like it

Reading published literature and blogging a few derivative observations is not research

Critiquing/finding flaws in published papers is indie peer-review, not research
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195806253722718208
        - Note #2: I enjoy proper research, but wasn’t a great talent even at my peak and am now likely at 60%. So in a way this is an okay market outcome. If I were wealthy I might do self-indulgent mediocre research for the rest of my life, but no reason you should pay for it.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195805398319546368
        - Note: peer-reviewed publishing or patents just as depth cal9bration. I wouldn’t necessarily publish in such forms since I don’t think those institutional processes have ever added much to my work. Nor into them tbf, in the peer reviewing I’ve done. But I’d aim for that depth.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195803626221883392
        - This isn’t cheap talk btw. I dropped 2k on a personal Matlab license after I went indie and kept it current for years, and went through dozens of false starts working on various ideas. Couldn’t find the time to develop any of them to even bad-conference-paper level.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195803105251606528
        - Even if the most expensive research tools like LHC or Hubble got as cheap as Arduinos, it wouldn’t help. That’s not the cost bottleneck. The bottleneck is researcher time. Even crappiest, cheapest conference paper I ever wrote took at least 6 months (~7k grad student salary then)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195801689476890624
        - The reason software doesn’t eat R&amp;D even though people think it should is that tools or open access to published lit/libraries, or free peer-reviewed publishing/presentation forums (if you want that) are only a tiny fraction of the cost for most ideas. The main host is time.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195800271894368256
        - Best-case outcome if neither applies: your idea has commercial potential and you can get a startup out of it. Which means the vast majority of ideas, both STEM and humanities, are out. Even I’m not optimist enough to think your R&amp;D on 16rh century French poets can be a unicorn.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195799062710108160
        - tldr: Get tenure, or get rich. Software has not eaten R&amp;D, and won’t eat it anytime soon. Possible outliers like Satoshi (who may have been in an R&amp;D institution or indie-wealthy in 2009 for all we know) notwithstanding.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195798359417577472
        - That’s the real deal. Anyone below that threshold calling themselves an independent researcher is either talking about something like market research or trend research (which is really environmental intelligence work not R&amp;D in the sense that interests me), deluded, or lying.

        - John Carmack announcing he was quitting oculus to do indie research on AGI finally made the stark equation clear. You need Carmack-level starting points (indie wealth, established R&amp;D celebrity record) to go indie. That’s basically modern equivalent of old nobility.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195796141213769728
        - With a blogpost, it’s like a week of effort at most from idea to mvp, and at most a 3:1 ratio of invisible to visible. That’s sustainable as a hobby/side thing. 

To do research-grade thinking you basically have to be independently wealthy and accept 90% deadweight losses
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195795503495053312
        - Research = 

a) long time between having an idea and having something to show for it that even the most sympathetic fellow crackpot would appreciate (not even pat for, just get)

b) a &gt;10:1 ratio of background invisible thinking in notes, dead-ends, eliminating options etc

        - You can at best target a research problem on a marketplace where someone has already declared a bounty, like say innocentive, nine sigma, etc (in which case they’re few and narrow). But that’s hardly independent. If you want to define and work on a problem you choose, it’s your $

        - If I spent 6 months working on a new robot navigation algorithm or a study of government failure risk in Latin America or a deep study of some artist, nobody would buy it at a price that would pat for what it cost to do even in pure living costs terms.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1195791313318207489
        - Unlike the market for general interest writing, the market for R&amp;D is almost entirely institutional, and they don’t really “buy” indie R&amp;D. It’s 99.9% crackpot inventors, 0.1% black swan stuff.

        - I was briefly calling myself an independent researcher: somebody who self-funds spec R&amp;D on their own ideas. In theory it’s something like indie-research : academic research :: blogging/self-publishing : traditional publishing.

        - Theory: a knowledge-based institution is only as good as its primary internal "genre" of briefing material (style, composition principles etc). It doesn't matter whether it's the famous Amazon 6-pager or a slide-deck pro-forma. It has to be a learnable skilled genre.

        - People want to believe in futures marked by active agency and willful action, but sometimes the desire for willful action is wishful thinking. Institutionalists want to create new institutions. Marketists want to give markets time to operate. Militarists want to shoot people.

        - If you're fundamentally a pessimist, your task is to time the irrational-exuberance bubble epochs and short them. Permabear and permabull are both derpy futurist positions. The meaningful bets are on the transience of dark and gilded ages against a secular arc-of-history posture.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193977920491900928
        - The interesting question is predicting the lengths of the counter-cycles of the overall trend you think prevails. If you're fundamentally an optimist who thinks the arc of history is about progress overall, your task is to time the dark age lengths.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193977517788389376
        - Optimism versus pessimism is a very tedious kind of debate since history has always been multiharmonic cyclic overlaid on secular trends that can be interpreted as either progress or decline.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193977338423201793
        - The entire stack of modernity is shearing. The pace-layering is hard to call. But the length of the "dark age" can be anything from 10 to 100 years depending on the details of the shearing dynamics. The bigger the stack refactoring you think is going on, the longer the dark age.

        - Think of it as this. Whatever "this" is, it's the result of software eating the world. The only question is what are we rhyming with here?

        - In purely technological revolutions, the interim tends to be between 1-3 decades. But when you're also simultaneously reinventing political and economic institutions, it could take much, much longer. Hence the dark-age scenario, which is more serious than people want to believe.

        - But any positive dynamics are going to take longer than 10 years to have an impact. Collapse is faster than wealth-creation processes. Which is why you get busts while they race each other. Amara's Law of returns (overestimate short term/underestimate long term)

        - If this seems like a doom-and-gloom thread, it isn't really. There's plenty of room for positive dynamics to be spun up in this 3 act saga. My narrow point is that these motivating "broken system" problems aren't solvable and won't be solved.

        - This is going to be ridiculously ineffective. A bunch of people in miserable little communes larping their favorite post-apocalyptic scenarios. But it should be entertaining to watch if you happen to pick one of the minority of good ones to spectate from.

        - So we'll default to the pop-science/tech idea of what's the best Plan B, which will be most people choosing to create survivable lower-density/lower-scale communities that mitigate local impact of effectively abandoned global climate action efforts.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193973231201353728
        - To be clear this is not a good thing. Technologically, climate action is best driven by densification and energy efficiency. We're just not going to go down that route. By 2024 we'll have concluded that climate action at the scale/speed we think is necessary is impossible.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193972923431706624
        - The chances of political action fixing electoral college system in the US are low to zero. The system simply isn't that adaptable. But one thing that CAN do it is massive migration to hinterland and real reversal of the urban migration that began in the 1880s.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193972540160430080
        - So domestic migrations rewiring the political landscapes of large countries will dominate in a few years. I'll make a fun but low-confidence prediction. If we're still doing this meme thing, the top meme of 2023 will have some sort of physical mobility/migration theme.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193972126685917184
        - We've been focused on climate migration/refugees across national borders because the biggest early failures are/will be failures of weak states in the face of climate-related collapses. But in the next wave, even strong stages with functional institutions will start to unravel.

        - I'm calling this a colonization pattern because that is what it will be. Since the target zones are not empty or political blank slates. There have been many examples of this sort of movement in history and the sustained conflict that results between "locals" and migrants.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193971424727191552
        - By 2024, this mood will have organized itself in the form of entire subcultures having identified and targeted and begun moving towards "microcolonization" destinations (kinda like some libertarians have already targeted New Hampshire). Domestic urban pilgrim streams.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193971030227898368
        - That will trigger Act 3, the technological vote-with-feet/lifestyle choice era. There is big mood in favor of abandoning increasingly unlivable metros, but people so far don't feel the pain enough to act on *communal* out-migration fantasies. Only individual/family trickles-outs.

        - In the 4 years, best case for traumatized precarity is that Warren will try and fail to deliver medicare for all, trust busting, or student loan forgiveness or UBI or anything. And the precariat will start abandoning urban economies for remote work economies.

        - In 3 years it's obvious that traumatized whiteness has not actually been solved by Trumpism. It's just handed out some palliative care in the form of twitter owns. In the next year, that will "settle" into a permaweird limbo equilibrium, kinda like Richard Spencer.

        - Simpler version of the whole story:

2016: Vote with memes
2020: Vote with dollars
2024: Vote with feet

This is assuming the core 3 tragic problems remain unsolved and nobody sees any net increase in agency/imagination.

        - Live player/dead player is a choice to act with agency *in whatever form it is available to you*. So weak live players band together in collective action tactics as they weaken. Disenfranchised players band together in civil disobedience actions as they weaken. Etc.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193961159533027328
        - In general, in all these democracy riots, the systematic political miscalculation is believing live players to be dead players. Weakening players are not dead players and dead players are not extinct players. There are downcycling weapons-of-the-weak available at every stage down

        - Just like in 2016, institutional elites had concluded that of course illiberalism had been permanently falsified in 1933 and ethnonationalosts couldn’t aggregate into political contenders at all, except in extremist Greece/Italy form which of course couldn’t happen here.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193942350327795712
        - Effectively they’ve used the failure of 1910s vintage communism to convince themselves aggregate low-wealth political interests is not a contender at all in the Darwinian political arena, except in extremist Venezuelan form which of course can’t happen here.

        - I think they all sincerely believe in some sort of “approximate meritocracy and Darwinian competition” folk theory, where even if they are compassionate rather than contemptuous towards precariat, they think it’s the only way the world can work. They’re TINA theorists.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193940840952938502
        - I’ve now heard multiple very wealthy people (n ~ 6) argue that inequality is a misframing and wealthsplain the “real problem” to me. They’re missing the point. If enough people believe “inequality” is the right framing, it will prevail and direct the anger energy.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193940216848871424
        - Why? Because if it can’t find electorally legitimate (module Russia) expression it feels is proportionate to energy, you’ll get more chaotic riots not less. Think Hong Kong.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193939366126600195
        - In fact I think that’s the likely outcome. Traumatized whiteness had the strong tailwind of electoral college mechanics to make itself heard and let off steam at White House level. 

Traumatized urban precariat has a strong headwind in the same department. This is bad news.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193938446764523521
        - I don’t think Bernie strikes the right note in representing the anger. His message is too big-tent dilutive of inequality.

But even if both lose and a more wealth-friendly candidate (Trump or one of the other Democrats) wins, the anger energy will define 2020-24.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193938052239900672
        - The “enemy” in the inequality riots election is a Venn diagram of 3 parties: billionaires, urban NIMBYs in high value geographies, and stock-owning class that has seen nominal wealth balloon from QE-buyback loop. Warren and Yang are the paladins vying to represent the anger.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193937331830452224
        - In 2016 elites didn’t realize the extent to which opioid crisis had become the rallying symbol of anger, whatever its actual importance in the larger scheme of things.

In 2020 the wealthy aren’t realizing the extent to which housing/urban blight have become the rallying symbol
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193936426519236613
        - In 2016 we clung to stories about how “America was already great” and global prosperity that simply weren’t believed by activated crowd.

In 2020 they cling to stories about historic stock market highs and low unemployment that simply aren’t being believed by activated crowd.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193935672588943361
        - They think it’s about defeating Warren the way we thought it was about defeating Trump. 

They think “reasonable” explanations pointing out how their mental models are misframed and the anger misdirected will defuse the anger just as in 2016.

        - In 2016, clueless institutional elites like me had NO idea how much disaffected whites were directing (however inappropriately) their hulk-smash energy towards us. In many cases targeting institutions they weren’t aware they were dependent on.

2016: Traumatized whiteness = “nationalism” = loot elite and impersonal state institutions 

2020: Traumatized precariat = “inequality” = loot market institutions and large corps of the Buyback 500

2024: Traumatized planet = “climate change” = loot ?
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193932728799903748
        - It’s like how in riots over any issue, small businesses get looted because they are visible targets that vaguely rhyme with the obscure root causes of whatever is angrying up the mob. 2016-28 is going to be “riot democracy” with the vote being about “who gets to loot next?”
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193931425357021184
        - These problems are not solvable. Only crashable. As in a Flight 93 takeover and crashing of the institutions seen (mostly incorrectly) as responsible, without better ones ready to fill the vacuum, and without regard to actual functions. So in each case “now you have 2 problems.”

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193928993319215104
        - One reason big problems rarely actually get solved is that most people are easily bought off by being given an opportunity to be seen/heard as having the problem. Not only are they satisfied with the recognition, they resist actual solutions because the problem is their identity.

        - 7. Real systems (e.g. biological organisms, particle formation, evolution of species) exhibit the same teleology, painting a picture of a universe ordered at multiple scales, toward interesting sorts of ends like working against entropy, staying out of equilibrium, &amp; growing.
            - https://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305559132340224
        - 6. To be ordered to some end is teleological.
            - https://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305528803328000
        - 4. Becoming thus functions as a modal filter, reducing being to actuality from an infinite plenitude of possible attributes. https://t.co/7pIp9TwYt2
            - https://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305505432629248
        - 5. To filter modally is to sacrifice a potentially infinite array of possible ways of being for an actuality. This is to say that the being *becomes ordered to* the actuality.
            - https://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305492304490496
        - 3. This entails that a new attribute accrues to the thing. Things actually acquire being by relating.
            - https://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305474482880512
        - 2. Hence, to come into real relation with something is to become part of the universe in some new respect (namely, the respect in which the things are related).
            - https://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305461757317121
        - After all, if ends are just in our heads, then they're all "superstitious" and we can forget the whole enterprise.

And now to identify teleology as a real process:

1. A thing is only something if it's something to something else. https://t.co/c0ERMnlrTb
            - https://twitter.com/arlynculwick/status/1193305437774336001
        - How do we avoid purposes being mere superstitious nonsense?

This starts, for me, with the question of whether any ends are real, or if they're all just mind-dependent constructs in a universe devoid of goals or meaning. https://t.co/lbESVcjd3k

        - Having any reason to go to Neptune is better than no reason, but a good reason is better than a nonsensical one, and more likely to catalyze success by a meaningful means-ends chicken egg virtuous feedback. Having an accurate sense of ends helps refine the means and vice versa

        - These goal-gods who induce ends to match overpowered means are kinda silly but they are better than nothing if they get you moving. Superstition is a symptom of grasp exceeding reach (cf 
“A man’s reach should exceed his grasp, else what’s a heaven for” which is backwards)

        - Much of internet tech is a means to access inner space. You can become more kinds of very different person. If your life were a space mission, with different destinations being different possible versions of future you, you should probably construct better maps of becoming.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193210562655612928
        - Eg.

What should you do: “follow your passion!”

How should you do it: “Learn how to build websites, run Kickstarter campaigns, fine-tune conversion funnels, and use agile methods to iterate quickly, testing rigorously along the way”

See an impedance mismatch there?
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193209258113818625
        - We approach the potential of the internet like a spacefaring culture of literalist astrologers. Where space missions are planned seriously at the level of “Crewed Dragon mission launched by a Falcon Heavy with 5 mission specialists and one cult-of-Mars priest”
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193208498529505280
        - Reason I’m thinking about this is that under digital modernity, since ~2000, our means have vastly expanded. There’s a vast ecosystem of how-to instrumental education around everything from SEO and blogging to machine learning and startups. But our ends-thinking hasn’t budged.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193207669340770305
        - Often both get abstracted away. The Hindu ritual to launch projects (from new factories to space missions) is to crack a coconut as an offering to Ganesha in his role as obstacle-remover god (Vighneshvara). It’s a nonspecific prayer that can later be used to explain good luck.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193206989800624128
        - But mismatch has to be very severe, and both means and ends have to be at similar levels of abstraction. One way to mitigate the dissonance is to make one more abstract. Like imagine war god being merely an ineffable presence around dirt ball rather than a guy in a palace there.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193205977681518592
        - Either your means will stall at the limit of your primitive ends (you’ll pray to the war god) or belief on the primitive end will fail as your means evolve (Mars gets demoted from war god to dirt ball)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193205123725479937
        - This seems absurd to me. A civilization that has mastered such an advanced means must necessarily have abandoned primitive ends along the way (at least among the principals involved in both the what and how if missions). Means-ends impedance mismatch.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1193204688490905601
        - Can you imagine a civilization that knows how to build rockets and spacecraft and has mastered orbital mechanics, but holds a consensus belief in astrological interpretations of the universe? Ie they can get to Mars, but their reason to go there is to meet the god of war?

        - To get inside the OODA loop of a book, survey its index, perhaps making a mind map of it. If it’s a good index, it will map log-level contours. The ToC is good for deciding whether to read a work by an already trusted writer. The index is for deciding whether to trust an author.

        - The metaphor of “turnings” is good. There are acceleration stresses that warp generational relationships. The outcome depends on the mass of the generation. Low mass generations trapped between two high mass ones cannot stand the stresses of their turnings and shear off.

The Boomer reaction strikes me as “do not go gently into the night, rage rage against the dying of the light.” Especially the youngest ones with a few decades left on the clock.

        - Much of the reactionary political wave in the west is a growing sense of unease over China saying “Ok America/West”

In both cases the confidence behind the posture is somewhat insecure, but it can only grow, while the deprecated adversary can only weaken.

        - I’m reminded of the Seinfeld episode with the Mandelbaum family. That episode starts with Jerry giving them the benefit of doubt on relevance, but ends with what’s effectively an “ok mandelbaums” punchline. By the end  it’s no longer  even worth humoring their self-importance

        - In general, when one side in a conflict is more time-rich, this will always happen. The adversary turns into a lame duck due to mortality, no matter how much nominal power they have. The NPV of their power declines to “mostly harmless”.

It will happen to X’s, Ms, Zs in turn.

        - @nwilliams030 @visakanv Most non-Indians try to wobble at the neck joint, which looks more like windshield wipers

The side-to-side movement is harder and more dancey. The trick there is to lead with your chin as you go side to side, keeping head vertical. Some people simply can't do this one.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192556838874599424
        - @nwilliams030 No, sounds like a @visakanv type of thing

My personal dissection of the head wobble when people ask me to teach them is to imagine your head oscillating about an axis going through the nose front to back. So the chin and top of head move in opposite direction.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192556156339666944
        - @nwilliams030 Interestingly, both the movements most associated with Indians, the head wobble and the side-to-side head thing, are also stylized gestures in classical dance forms... so you could generalize your point about indescribable movement patterns to entire cultures.

        - Time abundance is not like other kinds of abundance, since there is a non-stationary flow and an asymmetry to it. You can't store time the way you can surpluses of other sorts. All you can do is tweak your intentions towards things "filling" time from "must do" to "can ignore"

        - If you're middle class or above, time is almost always an abundant quantity, so long as you're willing to sneak off. What creates the sense of insufficient time is the idea that everything on your to-do list is a must-do. You're not short of time, you're long on commitment.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192540754234630144
        - Concrastrinate: the opposite of procrastinate. Always doing the most efficient/effective next thing on an endless to-do list, and never sneaking off to work on stuff you're not supposed to be working on.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192540115203055616
        - The value of the stock goes up and down as the clarity and agency go up and down through use and abuse. Successful concepts ossify and attract growing abuse, creating disruption opportunities. As a memester, you have to watch the meme markets for "startup" opps basically.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192533377699598337
        - Implicit in this model is that conceptual meaning is not something that evolves from fluid usages and eventually "arrives" by landing in a dictionary or other canonical reference work, like an IPO. Conceptual meanings are like companies with stocks on a meaning stock market.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192533103736020992
        - I'd like to try and teach semantic disruption skills at some point, but I don't yet have a clear sense of what kind of preparedness you'd need to pick up on this. It's a bit like being a meme VC, knowing when a concept is right for disruption and that an angle on it is working
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192532699346395136
        - How do you know your attempt at semantic disruption is working? Two signs:

Social proof: people resonate wit your sense of usage. They train on, and add to, your use instances.

Material proof: navigating with that concept yields better-than-random results, ie it finds agency
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192532208042381312
        - Most of the terms people are suggesting in the replies: community, agile, data-driven, fit this pattern. They are reifications in search of a locus of agency that may or may not exist, and you won't know till you try to "land" the concept on a pattern of agency that seems to work
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192531704365211648
        - There are banal things you can do that alter time experience. I'm not even talking drugs or base jumping. I'm talking stuff like drinking coffee or going to sleep. Those alterations are not to bare-metal time proper, but to the lowest level reification that offers some agency.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192531256841363456
        - One I'm working on right now is "temporality". Why not just say "time"? Because "time" offers no agency unless you know how to travel at relativistic speeds or shrink yourself down to sub-Planck quantum levels. "Temporality" is a way to pick out locus of agency just above "time"
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192530511811362816
        - A good heuristic for picking out this condition is to apply John Wannamaker's observation "I know half my advertising works, I just don't know which half."

This is why "marketing" is hard. The semantic noise induced by the illegibility of the agency sought.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192530084814454784
        - Take for example, the word "strategy". It attempts to create agency at higher levels of abstraction in thinking about conflict. The agency involved in pulling a trigger is obvious. The agency involved in moving tokens around on a map in a war-room is not.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192529751824429056
        - A common pattern I've noticed in terms that are vulnerable to this pattern of concept creep and semantic decay is that they pick out attempts to create agency out of reifications, and there is some actual agency there. Just hard to pick out, acquire, and exercise well.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192527068673630208
        - But the BIG trick is to not reveal what you're doing until/unless it actually catches on, and people start saying things like "sociopath in the gervais principle sense". It's like a test of success in the form of taking a word-stock into private equity, then re-IPOing it.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192526786812231681
        - My book Tempo (which grew out of my postdoc project, which in turn kinda grew out of my false-start project with my buddy to reconstruct "strategy") attempts something similar. It is built around a somewhat idiosyncratic, but not too heterodox core sense of "strategy".
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192526535527301120
        - It turned into a shtick for me at some point, and is probably the conceptual basis of how I do a lot of my meme-inception type writing. Eg. Gervais Principle is based on trying to disrupt the word "sociopath"
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192526260980703232
        - The aim is to almost achieve a semantic disruption of sorts. If the "market" for a term is all the ways it is used, arranged in some sort of tag cloud, with a bad/bureaucratic vacuous center, you disrupt by picking a more meaningful thing on the margins.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192526019401355266
        - The private definition should be chosen not for Grand Unified Theory potential of the term's history, but pick out and exaggerate an elegant new core in the connotation cloud. It's like caricature mixed with rebasing (in the sense of picking a new origin for a coordinate system)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192525773187366912
        - The trick to the clean-up exercise is to avoid the temptation to rigorously analyze the history of the concept and propose a cleaned up definition. Thar be legalism and bureaucracy. 

Instead, just impose a *private* definition on yourself and stick to it with discipline.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192525360442695680
        - Back around 2002, I had a friend in grad school who was studying law and philosophy of language. He was also a Navy vet. We proposed a little project (didn't really get off the ground) to analyzing the concept creep of "strategy" over the decades and reconstruct it more cleanly
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192525053016952832
        - A good hack to find interesting ideas to work on is to start with a word that seems to pick out an important concept, but has been rendered annoyingly vacuous by abusive overextension. Examples: strategy, meaning, irony. Other examples?

        - It’s postcampy. If camp is “failed seriousness” (Susan Sontag) postcamp is failed irony transcendence.

The misreading of cynicism as irony is revealing. There is pure cynicism, and cynicism as a reductive perception of irony. Postcampies cant tell the two apart.

        - Most attempts at transcending irony seem to fail in ironic ways. Mostly it’s ineffectively reactionary sincerity in response to cynicism, rather than irony. A response that appears to not actually be sensitive to irony in the first place.

        - It's not an agile vs. waterfall thing. It's that PM of either flavor has the wrong ontology for everything going on. It doesn't capture the sense of herding a distributed, loosely synchronized set of local activities together in a foggy VUCA landscape, trying to engineer luck

        - Is it just me, or is "project management" as an idea kinda way past its limits when applied to software-eaten examples? The higher the bits:atoms ratio, the more project management breaks down for a given level of complexity (doesn't have to be software... just bit-dense)

        - Of course, it's much worse if you're in a volume business. 10k earned via 1000 $10 sales is $590, so about $300 more. The $0.30 per-tx fee really adds up in volume ops.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1192145984240795648
        - Stripe is super convenient for invoicing, and avoiding the headaches of POs and vendor management systems in favor of corp credit cards is totally worth it, but if you're used to ACH direct deposits or checks... man the tx fee feels painful. On a 10k invoice, fees are $290.3 😬

        - @vgr Result: we’re not richer, but we are more unequal. The financial elite gain not in consumption but in relative security. The extra “money” never corresponded to extra goods; it is fake; it is a measure of “low risk of eviction” more than a measure of “having nice things”

        - It is a category error to apply the adjective “broken” to a complex system. Complicated systems break. Complex systems merely enter hostile configurations relative to you. They’re not fixed by your functional expectations. They’re still working. Just not for you.

        - @mtraven Testament to the progress we’ve made that I actually didn’t find the rant disturbing or surprising. My initial reaction was “jeez, the guy is seriously mentally disturbed”. This would have been a normal mindset in the 1930s, but you have to be disturbed in the 2010s to hold it.

        - @s_r_constantin That makes sense. Pre-industrial Times, when patronage mattered more than personal resources for art, it would have been  more common to skip levels. There are also special conditions like rap and basketball being level-skipping ways out of poverty for black families.

        - Planning is not prediction. Prediction generally gets monotonically harder with time. But planning gets easier because agency wanes andctgeres fewer meaningful things you can do the farther out you look.

        - Avoid 4-6 year horizons. You don’t get the tractability of short term &lt;3y or the simplification of &gt;6y.

1 year is easy, 50 years is easy. 5 years sucks.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1191245835062767616
        - Long-termism is a kind of minimalism. The longer the planning horizon beyond a point, the fewer assumptions you can trust and the simpler things get. 

There’s a peak of planning complexity about 5 years out and weirdly that’s the horizon a lot of planning targets.

        - Throw in minimum wage store assistant labor even if you don’t pay yourself, at $15/hr, that’s another $150 in margin. Plus you’ve got inventory costs, write-offs (I wonder if these stores do consignment stocks with returns to the wholesaler/maker)...
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1191027289108074496
        - If the average item is say $25, that’s 20 sales/day. At a conversion rate of say 25% that’s 80 walk-ins, or 8/hour if you’re open 10h/day 7 days a week.

And this is bare minimum performance with generous assumptions. 

I bet most of these stores are losing money.

        - Okay so this thing has distribution backend too. I don’t get how these stores make money. At say $20/sq-ft for a 200 sq-ft store, you’re talking about $300 in margin/day just to cover rent. At say a 60% gross margin for overpriced tchotchkes, that’s $500/day revenue to cover rent https://t.co/YFOIYsiG8G

        - @vgr Was thinking about the constructedness of time the other day; if I travelled back in time a few thousand years and asked “is it Tuesday?” the question wouldn’t be hard to answer, it would be meaningless. The culture that coordinates around the calendar underwrites the calendar.

        - Back on earth, lunar and solar dissonance also keep astrologers employed, since the moon is very significant, but its movement against the stars is determined by both its own movement and the solar year.

        - Science fiction stories with alien species gloss over calendar tech too easily. A space-faring species would have to construct meaningful, galactic-scale, relativity-accommodating calendar systems. It would also need to reverse engineer the local society's calendar.

            - https://twitter.com/jstogdill/status/1190357140952629248
        - A calendar is more real based on the amount of temporal phenomenology it captures by default. If we picked most absolute T=0, which would be 13.2 billion years ago, and captured ALL the dynamics (including relativistic) between the Big Bang and us, how would the calendar look?

        - The solar cycle is better than a lunar cycle, but what's better than a solar cycle? A galactic cycle! Could you create a calendar with "leap" adjustments designed to somehow synch with galactic revolution? The galactic tick day is the beginning of that https://t.co/0NlEpdIj71
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190356130481852416
        - There are no calendars that do not require such janky adjustments. Only the scale differs. Regular leap years (4 year, 1 day), modern leap years, every 4th year, except every 100th year not divisible by 400. Modern atomic clocks need to add leap seconds here and there.

        - Lunisolar calendars try to triage the problem, by using lunar for daily needs, and a complex human-powered priesthood for the rare, expensive solar synchronization. If you think about it, it's like solving a small Y2K type problem every couple of years, by adding a month.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190355051409076224
        - But solar calendars despite being harder to technologically track, are more useful, since harvest cycles etc. follow solar patterns, and not many practically important things track lunar time (night-time safety?)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190354801063673856
        - The other alternative is to measure day length and know when the longest or shortest day passes. This requires minute-level precision in sub-day timekeeping, which is actually quite hard even with high quality hourglasses etc.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190354191950082048
        - Temporal collisions also reveal history. The reason most ancient cultures used lunar or lunisolar calendars is that it's actually hard to estimate solar year directly. You have to precisely track solstices ("sun standing still") which means keeping daily noontime elevation logs
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1190353782816698369
        - Anyone have any other such examples of temporality collisions/resonances/dissonances?

        - In general, you are rarely made conscious of just how arbitrary calendar time is. Technically, since the base year for the Indian calendar is 79AD, which is CE+78, I was born on 1, Kartik, 1896, and am already 45y old in lunar years, but still 44 by solar years.

        - I think the national-empire phase was worse. It had the same level of exploitation but an added layer of hypocritical idealism. The difference between the Imperial Raj and Company Raj in India was that the the company era people didn’t pretend (as much) to be noble idealists.

        - Theresa precedent though. Colonialism was a 2-phase affair. Phase 1, roughly 1600-1800, was corporations land-grabbing the new superhuman agency of new European transportation tech (sailing). Phase 2 was nations building empires (1800-WW2). It is debatable which was worse.

        - I have no suggestions. Constitutional governance doesn’t seem capable of the kind of agility necessary here. California is trigger happy with too many amendments and it doesn’t seem to help because it’s not actually driven by imaginative reconstitutional thinking.

        - That’s why we have this weird disconnect with 2 tracks of dissonant political conversations.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189935149179236352
        - Google for example is “superhuman power of search and free knowledge” and treating it as an obvious extension to DC’s or EU’s authority is misguided. It needs an expanded-consent v]conversation, which is pre-regulation, at the level of something like a constitution amendment.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189934237928943616
        - One reason corporations tend to win the early land grab for the ungovermed territory is that people equate “regulation” with “expanded governance under existing consent” rather than “renegotiated consent”
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189933722667122689
        - Here’s a thought. 

When human agency increases, andceverybody becomes say 10% more superhuman, the expanded agency isn’t automatically grandfathered into old social contract. It creates new ungoverned territory that requires an expanded consent-of-governed addendum.

        - PKD reality (that which doesn’t go away when you stop believing in it) is not generally dangerous to ignore/tune out. Most ignored reality never bites you or chase you as you retreat to escape. Believing the moon is made of blue cheese is not dangerous.

        - Contrarian take: we are getting more real, not less, more truthful, not less. Reality just happens to be vastly more noisy and confusing than we’ve been prepared to admit, and believing in untruths a lot less dangerous than we’ve been led to believe.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189765864142200832
        - Reports of the death of reality have been highly exaggerated. People enjoy pretending to believe in it more than they actually do, so they can get all dramatic about it and shock people by declaring “post truth” or whatever.

Post institutional consensus is not post truth.

        - 2x2: strength of believability vs cost of falsification

Note that many crackpot theories, while not unfalsifiable, are certainly costly to falsify for yourself personally. They enjoy a disbelief moat.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189763300675866624
        - None of these crisis commentators ever shows up at a church breathlessly reporting on the far more unbelievable belief systems being performed with much more literal belief inside. 

Possibly the difference is that crackpot theories are clearly in the zone of falsifiability.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1189762205119500288
        - In general, I think the people who do the hand-wringing “reality is broken” agonizing are actually part of the kayfabe. Overstating the case so strongly underlines how weak the belief actually is. Compared to traditional religion for example, it’s like 1% as serious.

        - Any of you ever given less than 5 stars for Uber/lyft? What was the reason? Do you do it routinely? Ever go below 4?

It’s turned into one of the most ceremonial things ever for me.

But what are these dots actually doing?  Can you find one that's not moving?

        - @APXHard Without specifying to whom a particular life has value, it becomes an empty aspiration. You could perhaps treat your UBI as an initial and declining subsidy, like a rolling book advance. Badly disabled etc will need to be explicitly adopted by people/institutions who care.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188205516977127424
        - @APXHard But the seller has an incentive to ensure transactions are logged since each transaction compounds future tax share. So only the desperate will accept black market transactions.

I don’t like “human life has value” as a design condition though I like the sentiment.

        - @scottomelianuk The “tax share” is basically equivalent to continuous IPO. Like supercharged bootstrapping. If you sell well, you get more of the share of taxes from ALL previous customers. That’s your capital.

        - The modern economy hasn’t had a design refresh since approximately the 1600s. We’ve just twiddled some knots and settings.

        - A lot of this is probably wildly flawed but the base insight I’m trying to work out is “not all planet scale emergent computing systems are equally powerful and expressive”

        - Afaict even the wildest blockchain or blockchain-like schemes don’t go this far. It’s a weird design, effectively turning the economy into a Hebbian deep learning system or something.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188199095942275072
        - Flatten market governance and make it coextensive with the market itself. Kill the gods of “interest rates” and a financial market system that sits like a heaven above the earthly basic transactional goods/services system.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188198602885087232
        - Not just brand equity, but regular equity could get absorbed by this scheme. You wouldn’t need a stock or bond market. Every transaction would be an implicit stock/bond tx as well. No need to bolt on a bottleneck long-term memory capital market onto amnesiac transaction market.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188198087656800256
        - This scheme would need a lot more computation per transaction btw, and effectively perfectly eidetic transactional memory. That alone inspires confidence it would be smarter. Price becomes a richer signal, with a past and future. Today’s economy is kinda amnesiac.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188197447798939648
        - This also sort of kills advertising. Current income sort of translates directly into brand equity that makes future income cheaper.. while moving it from private property to public commons. Lean into commoditization.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188196704580849664
        - So current direct spending drives future redistribution. With a shifting weight and forgetting/discounting factor. Eventually more and more of everybody’s income comes from the redistribution rather than direct. Private morphs smoothly into public utilities.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188196173028347904
        - So here’s an idea. Set aside a fixed tax fraction on my dollars. Every time I spend a dollar buying something from you, it strengthens a weight. My tax fraction is then periodically distributed among my transactional counterparties in proportion to the weights of transaction.

        - Let’s call the memetic equivalent of Gaia... Maia! 

Selfish Meme = Selfish Maia

How do you translate this refactoring into an economic idea? Trick might be to map transactions to reproduction rather than feeding.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188193871391412224
        - You are a holographic model of Gaia effectively. Inclusive fitness - Darwinian competition between competing Gaias, not genes, individuals, groups or species. Selfish Gene = Selfish Gaia theory.

A more powerfully expressive post-capitalism economics would do the same for memes.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188192978382180352
        - In genetics, every individual organism’s genome is a map of relationship to the entire biosphere. If you pass on your genes directly or indirectly, you also pass on 99% genes of chimpanzee genes, 80% of lobster genes etc (look up actual numbers... they’re in the ballpark)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188192449904046080
        - I’m not saying invent tax systems that model philanthropy. Philanthropic intentions are generally reactionary, tribal, worse than kin-selfishness. But it has the right kind of expressiveness of inclusion relationship: to people, whales, climate, space programs, whatever.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188191733646934018
        - This is very low resolution. It has little to no connection to my actual pattern of relationship behaviors. And there are mediating agents between me and tax beneficiaries who distort things further.

Look at patterns of philanthropy for a sense of actual felt relationship.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188191221723742208
        - Taxes model inclusive fitness coarsely. If I earn a dollar, pay $0.15 in federal taxes, $0.15 in state income and sales taxes, and $0.05 in local taxes, retaining $0.65 in consumed/saved value, all citizens are like ~second cousins, fellow state citizens are ~first cousins etc.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188190465226461184
    - 
        - If you look at history, “business” effectively evolved out of cultural kin selection. Powerful clans looking out for themselves against monarchs and peasant masses etc. Capitalism just shrank the unit from &gt;3 generations extended family to &lt;3 generation nuclear.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1188189348182687744
        - Definitions in case you’re unfamiliar with them. Personal and inclusive are ways of coupling relational identity and behavior. Inclusive fitness (selfish gene) is more accurate than personal fitness (selfish person or kinship group)

        - After napping on it, I have a theory of what ails capitalism: it is not Darwinian enough.

The “selfish” motive in Adam Smith corresponds to personal fitness rather than inclusive fitness. Taxation is a crude and insufficiently precise mechanism to add inclusive fitness back in. https://t.co/JWLNC8egy3

        - I’m fundamentally sympathetic to capitalism but if I had to make a critique, it would be: it institutionalizes an unrealistically cynical view of human nature, rendering idealism unreasonably ineffective and self-defeating

        - @vgr My first book radically changed everything, but also nothing. It cemented &amp; focused my identity as a writer (which I already carried), affirmed my belief that I could create enduring, valuable things (I already knew), and formalized my bond with like-minded folk (already felt).
            - https://twitter.com/emilysuvada/status/1188165966615629824
        - Half of these critiques are “broken mechanism, does not work as advertised” critiques

The other half is “works as advertised, and morally flawed by design” critiques

        - @vgr Writing Lauren Ipsum helped me work through gaps in my education and proved at least to me that compsci teaching is in need of serious compression. It also paradoxically showed up big limitations in how I approach compsci.

        - @MikeWamungu That would actually increase the kind of risk I care to mitigate. The tight/agile iterative feedback loops of social media writing are very bad for book-scale writing. If you use them you end up writing what reads like a series of blog posts/essays, begging the question.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187894784104390659
        - The biggest internal reason to try and write a book is to challenge yourself to hunt down a much larger idea than social media allows. Books allow you to aim for intellectual outer space. At the moment, social media only allows you to achieve low-altitude atmospheric flight.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187893558771998720
        - Almost any specific external effect or outcome of a book I can bring myself to care about, I can immediately think of like 6 better ways to achieve through much easier and more fun ways through blog posts etc. A book is usually the worst medium for most kinds of actual impact.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187893079816032256
        - One of the effects of being an internet-native writer, with enough success to foster a degree of arrogance, is that "book" motivations that work for trad writers don't work for you. You already know that many of the rewards of book-writing are better realized through blogs etc.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187891740864155648
        - Hence the OP question. I genuinely want to know what sorts of interesting+unexpected external effects might result specifically from a book form factor. No, not media coverage, hobnobbing with glitterati etc (based on small tastes I've had, those are active demotivators for me)
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187891503206526976
        - It doesn't help that a couple of Very Famous and Important People I know, when I described the project to them, wondered why I didn't just write it as a series of blog posts or videos. Good question. I don't yet have a good answer. I need one.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187890558376660993
        - The null hypothesis ("why not just tweet it all out/write it as a blog series/capture it as a series of video lectures") is actually surprisingly strong, and it's going to take work to properly commit to the alt hypothesis ("this is demanding to be a book").

        - @vgr I published a collection of my selected prose juvenilia in Spanish earlier this year. It hasn’t opened up anything by way of opportunities yet, but nor was it designed to. It’s more of an effort to clear out drawers and facilitate access to readers.

        - While I'd be very pleased with huge bestseller status etc. as an accidental side effect, it is not something that can motivate me, and not an objective I'm capable of solving for even if it did (for Halloween, I mocked up a "bestseller" type table of contents and scared myself)

        - I have strong internal reasons for wanting to write a second book that are enough to keep me at it, but frankly the external reasons are weak to non-existent for the kind of book I want to write. So wondering what I could do to make it have more interesting+unexpected impact.

        - Not trying to shill the course here (it's not very useful unless you are actually fairly invested in longform writing already)... but these pre-reads are generally REALLY helpful for becoming a better thinker and problem solver in general, whether or not you write.

        - Good pre-reads for courses should be so well-chosen that for someone who hasn't read them, they constitute 90% of the value of the course. Looking back, I think we actually hit that with the pre-reads for the longform course (the pre-reads page is open) https://t.co/H8WIygCiv5

        - @fortelabs @visakanv The problem with books etc is that they’re easily faked as credibility signals. You could write a 250 page book that actually has an idea of that scale, or you could just fluff out what should be a twitter thread with filler. For too many dumb gatekeepers there’s no difference.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187814635426045952
        - @fortelabs Look at digital native things. Authoring a consciously crafted warren of interlinked threads like @visakanv is not a case of new media eating and commoditizing old media. It’s a case of new media uncommoditizing itself out of a commodity default layer. 

It’s an expensive signal.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187797832272494592
        - It is tempting to think of there being a ground truth cultural reality with different must-inhabit temporalities being co-extensive and nonrivalrous imperative coverings of it. Many maps for different journeys, one territory. Any journey that is not prohibited is mandatory.

        - @swimming_blerd I agree, it is 100% dubious and I don’t actually believe it, but that’s the point. Historicity is a construct that a) you can opt-in to b) has no pr9vileged version.

It’s more than popular appeal, but falls short of an absolute temporality (which I argue cannot exist)

        - I’ve never knowingly listened to Kanye (though I take my musical friends at their word that I’m missing something historic), but unlike the law of gravity, or hard edged laws of justice system, the consequences of not obeying the must-listen law are not as clear. But they exist.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187794101510402050
        - One key idea behind my multitemporality thesis is that it is possible to not read must-reads, not listen to must-listens, etc and still stay not alive, but in time. Ie experience a coherent temporality and be in history. 

Ie there is no privileged necessary trunk temporality
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187793296694726657
        - @swimming_blerd I think that’s a grey zone thing. Popularity is weak social proof of potential historicity, but some things embody actual historicity, where past and future of X don’t make sense without X. Memes that flood the meme pool.

        - To not listen to say John Legend is merely a matter of taste/cultural choice

To not listen to Kanye is to forgo an entire timeline, a way of being in time

To the extent you think music is a necessary strand of history, it is sitting out *the* timeline. Consensus reality trunk.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187792194142269440
        - But back to sat Kanye West as a must-listen. It isn’t authoritarian, and it’s totally opt-in to Nation of Ye, but there is a certain force of necessity there nevertheless. It is a precondition for participation in a temporality; a way of being in historical time.

        - In the US it is mostly must-recognize but only subset have memorized the whole thing. It’s twice as long, almost as archaic (not a dead language but older English), and most ceremonial performances require standing but not sing-along. In part because it’s a harder melody to sing.

        - A national anthem is a good edge case. In India, it is short, in Sanskrit (so most of us don’t actually understand it), and universally memorized. A true must-know. And hammered in because you must actually sing it frequently in schools. Not just stand for it.

        - Divine right of kings and absolute rule of divine law produce versions of deterministic agency closure (forbidden+compulsory = everything) via cults of personality or legalism.

Cultural determinism is an attempt to manufacture that imperative force.

        - In what sense is a must read a must read? Or a must-watch a must-watch? Or a must-listen a must-listen?

Or to generalize, a must-obey cultural consumption/knowledge imperative. 

It is a version of authoritarian “what isn’t prohibited is compulsory” but an unusual kind

Actually helping people, LAP

You could stack on any of these

        - A related humanist principle is “to understand everything is to forgive everything”

This allows for pseudo free will. You can make choices, there will be wrong choices in proportion to knowledge, and you can’t be held responsible by those who know better.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187758559469043712
        - @APXHard This principle says if you know everything about a state S, all actions but 1 will be impossible, and the 1 action will be unavoidable. So no choice.

        - Closing this gap = exercise of raw power and hiding anything whose appearance cannot be made to conform to omniscience/omnipotence posture. 

Interestingly this always requires totalitarian human rulers. Totalitarian rule systems alone can’t maintain the appearance of totality.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187757266616737792
        - In practice both prohibitions and compulsions constrain behavior down to a resolution threshold of indifference. That threshold is where gap between world perception and claimed complete knowledge of the world is small enough that you can credibly claim omniscience/omnipotence

        - You can only be free in proportion to the ignorance you acknowledge

Everything you claim as knowledge will force you to act or run into a constraint
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187755206819246081
        - Or equivalently, freedom to act or not act in non-totalitarian systems is a function of an explicit procedural accommodation of formal ignorance. 

“It’s neither forbidden, nor compulsory” = “we don’t know”
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187754681700765697
        - So there is no such thing as a pure observer view of the world. If you know something you must either act on it or be actively constrained from acting by law.

Human totalitarianism is a sort of illusory physics based on a manufactured illusion of perfect knowledge.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187754116249870337
        - The general idea is agency closure over a perfect knowledge condition. There is no non-instrumental knowledge. Everything that is known can drive action, and all action not prohibited by law must happen.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1187753306325602305
        - In the physics interpretation it leads to the sum over histories method and many worlds interpretation. What happens is a function of everything that *could* happen. So there is no room for free will at the multiverse level of quantum description. Every path must be in the sum.

        - @visakanv Hard to tell without pictures here whether this case is about one of the edge cases. But the guy’s evasiveness with pretty clear cases like Obama or Kwame suggests something else is going on. But you’d need more than lazy skin-tone questions to pin Ryan and show intent.

        - @visakanv It‘s ambiguous here as well, but not THAT ambiguous. It’s not skin color alone. It’s a cluster of features: skin color, lips, hair, etc. But in 90% of cases, 90% would probably pick out “black” clearly. The correlation cluster is strong. It’s non-black darks that are ambiguous.

        - @catvincent @m_older Active hostile design (anti-homeless spikes for example) is not the same as positive access rights infrastructure like ramps or elevators. And if there’s a marginal extra cost to ensuring access to a group due to disability, it’s a different issue than mere permissions/rights.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186046031726690305
        - @catvincent @m_older I’m wary of conflating borders and disability support though. It’s important to distinguish permissions from accessibility. Ensuring a notional right to be present in a space is important separately from enabling that presence.

        - @m_older In general every public space has an attached notion of “default human” and globally that default is actually non-white men in most places. But yeah, women and children have very few public spaces anywhere where they count as default human and men are the alien presence.

        - @m_older Yeah I get what you mean. Your face is your visa scoping your rights in public as well. That generalizes to everybody to some extent though. White men are not exempt when they travel in non-white countries, even if their prison is a restrictive halo.

        - Trigger-happy gun nuts who would in fact instantly shoot anyone in their claimed territory in a shoot-on-sight mode are either people under orders from military/police regimes OR crazy people who take our space-governance systems a little too literally.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186023842327625728
        - Our basic mutuality-humanity-recognition instincts are actually far more humane than the design of laws and formal structures we've developed to codify/govern them. Design is inhumane because designing to the "limit of decency" is actually hard.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186023485622996992
        - Under most circumstances, most of us (not even most 2nd amendment gun nuts) wouldn't instantly harm someone we found in our space (home, office) who wasn't an obvious clear and present danger. We'd challenge/talk to them, call the cops or something.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186023167875145728
        - This is already kinda de facto true. You may find the ranting, smelly homeless person on the sidewalk objectionable, but to the extent you peacefully go around them, you're recognizing their human right to personal space.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186022764869644288
        - So for example, "basic human rights" = "we all grant each other basic presence rights in a personal-space spacetime bubble around wherever we happen to be"

        - Territorialityl is really an inhumane way to engineer humanity recognition. There's got to be a better way to let the mentally ill, diseased, physically disabled population live as best as they can without the rest of us effectively treating them like literal garbage to sweep-up.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186019526560735232
        - You could construct a ratio of some sort: (area you control)*(number of people who you would keep out under any circumstances)/(area controlled by people who wouldn't let you in under any circumstances).
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186018054901133312
        - We are all simultaneously prisoners and prison wardens. There are people who we wouldn't let past our exclusivity claim borders under any circumstances, and places we would't be allowed in under any circumstances. Without threat of violence in both cases.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186017756635811840
        - Like, I'd probably let in almost anyone credibly claiming a bathroom emergency. 

My "prisoners" would be people I wouldn't let in under any circumstances besides violence. So likely seriously unraveled/unhygienic homeless people, diseased people, people who seem threatening.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186017279760187393
        - Like, I have a nice apartment in a big metro. The cops and firemen and landlord have some rights to bust in without my permission. With respect to everybody else in the world, I'd let in almost anybody under particular conditions. So who do I "imprison" by claiming the apartment?
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186016728376954881
        - Guesting/hosting protocols and reciprocal roaming rights are where the meaning of "human" is legislated via de facto patterns of mutual recognition of roaming rights. Anyone you wouldn't allow in to territory you claim exclusively is in some mild way, your prisoner.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186016268857430016
        - Territorial claims are entirely about restricting the roaming range of others. Territorialists would scream bloody murder if you told them "fine you can have territory X so long as you never leave it"
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186015828631683072
        - In a way, nativism, property rights, and other forms of territoriality are a red herring. People with power to claim exclusive power over territory X generally have a roaming range FAR bigger than X. If you have a US passport and enough $, your roaming range is most of the world.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186014952047333376
        - Prisoners, homeless people swept back periodically into "bad" blocks, refugees, developing country people penned into weak-passport zones, etc etc.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186014840831111168
        - To first order, the degree to which your humanity is acknowledged by societal consensus is almost perfectly modeled by the territorial extent through which you can move pretty freely. I think this is why I react so strongly against walls/borders.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186014605102862336
        - The default strategy of cities seems to be pretty much sweep them up periodically and restrict them to "bad" blocks so they're out of sight and not much of a problem for others.  It's a sort of de facto concentration camp strategy. There's no guards or barbed wire, but that's it
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186013723904733185
        - Like I see cops/social workers occasionally step in to sort of bundle them up and move them along, but it is unclear to me how you even deal with people in this state. The cruel thing to do seems to be to institutionalize them in some bad under-resourced place.

        - Concretely, there's an old woman outside the starbucks I'm at who is shaking, clearly in mental distress, kinda ranting, and sitting in a pile of what I can only consider garbage mixed with some food

        - @rcdaut I'm looking for a word or phrase to describe the appearance/behavior, not diagnosis. Like "loss of composure" is a much milder normal thing that you see that's line 2/10 on the spectrum where this is 9/10
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186012694949838848
        - Like a normal homeless person in possession of faculties might have hygiene problems and cart around stuff that's sad, but it's a sane way of being in a bad state. I can see myself doing the same in that situation. But this other mode... they're in an alt reality
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186012261879443456
        - Their material possessions play a role: they are kinda surrounded by a pile of basically garbage mixed with useful food/possessions and they can't seem to tell the difference. This might be the most clear symptom. A sort of hoarding syndrome except indiscriminate and disorganized
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186011578757345280
        - I'm blanking on a word to describe the unraveling of personhood you see in some homeless people in the grips of some sort of drug/non-drug psychosis. Uncoordinated movements, incoherent affect of terror/discomposure, loss of control of bodily function... what word would you use?
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186011194340937728
        - @staticsteven My point is, people would devote 100% of their available attention to content they pay (or is freemium supported by other subscribers) for IF they could find content that meets their needs. They turn to lower-quality ad-supported stuff because they can't.

        - I think the problem is actually going to be a vector misalignment problem. Even if you magically increased the amount of content, it wouldn't be aligned with what advertisers want to sell. But it would still quench the demand, so it would kill advertising from the demand side

        - I don't think I've seen this point made before, that there is actually a quantifiable demand for quality content for which the size of the advertising market is actually a near-perfect proxy.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186006927576186880
        - Why wouldn't ALL attention move from ads to subscriptions? Only reason I can think of is: available attention (audience hunger) and demand for it (advertiser hunger) far exceeds the amount of quality content available to catalyze it
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1186006369918259200
        - The unit economics of "content" are finally becoming clear 20 years in. 

500 views, monetized via subscription at 10% at say $2 per view, with a 10% commission to the platform is $1

500 views, monetized via ads at say $2 cpm is also $1. 

But one of these is a MUCH smarter $

        - When I compare my experience on teachable and substack to say youtube, twitter and facebook, it strikes me that "creator-centric" is simply a better experience all around. Absolutely the only reason NOT to do that is to trade off quality for high-volume/low-yield advertising.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185963429892251649
        - @ben_mathes My point is it is a secondary “interior” phenomenology, not a forcing functions defining the bounding box of constraints. Ie, there are no fundamental constraint laws there. In engineering you have quantum limit, in math you have P=NP, in bicycle/ux you have 2 eyes/10 fingers

        - @ben_mathes Individual languages may not be within their paradigm, but across languages with overlapping capability? That’s clearly undeterdetermined. You can pick a 1000 ways to output ‘hello world’ and there’s no “right answer”

        - @ben_mathes The bicycle part tends to be underrated because it’s had such limited scope until recently. I think of bicycle=UX as a placeholder art-science, kinda like alchemy or astrology before chemistry/astronomy. But with VR/AR, voice etc, it’s coming into its own as applied neuroscience
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1185952345814732801
        - @ben_mathes Mathematical aesthetics perhaps? Language design is underdetermined by all 3 elements (math, engineering, bicycle), that’s why there’s so much diversity there.

Bicycle is a good observation. In future it might just be applied neuroscience/biology.

I mean, you basically innovate against Moore’s law, programming is a derivative layer

OR 

Show that you have no conflicting relationship to anyone in your supply chain all the way down, so it is your purchasing that is inefficient.

        - The phrase “at cost” is meaningless for most transactions. Unless you buy from a perfect-competition commodity market and do all value-addition via commodity ops, there is always a hidden margin. You can make up bookkeeping fictions to pretend it’s zero margin. Doesn’t make it so

I’d like to deliver a little “I’m a &lt;huge commodity industry&gt; man” speech. Simple, self-effacing, plain-spoken way of representing a great, bloody, crushing force.

Sadly I don’t deal in any volume commodity https://t.co/9fzHY1aA3l

        - Reminds me of the idea of “service courses” from grad school teaching days. Teaching intro fluid mechanics or linear algebra was mildly useful as a refresher, but basically not fun. It was service work. Designing and teaching my one 600 level course otoh was a huge amount of fun.

        - The last few @artofgig issues have definitely been in this category. It’s not journalism, but it is service writing. Felt I had to have a decent 101-gigwork-basics series. Regular programming on the newsletter is me figuring stuff out for myself or just having fun. Ideally both.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1184988332209496065
        - I get now why “service journalism” is called that. As a writer, it’s basically unfulfilling so you genuinely have to bring a sense of service to the task to care enough to write half-decent things. You’re not learning/surprising yourself enough to make it personally fulfilling.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183903671311978496
        - The one difference here is that ISIS and Kurds are enemies, whereas in the 1980s, Pakistan was the supply chain to  the Mujahideen, and later the "handler" as it metastasized into Taliban, Kashmir foreign terror outfits and eventually Al Qaeda. It was a godawful mess. Still is.

        - Americans of course have a very... interesting memory of what happened. Basically, Rambo 3 (1988). Noble US supplies noble Mujahideen to force evil empire to withdraw. Led by Rambo.

The withdrawal was 1988-1989. Kashmiri insurgency began like 5 minutes later.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183902649260728320
        - Roughly, the 1980s/now mapping would be (purely structural balance of power, with no value judgments of politics/ideologies in play)

US = USSR
Russia = US
Kurds = Mujahideen
Syria = Afghanistan
Turkey = India
Pakistan = Iraq+ISIS
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183901789076066304
        - Shit, just realized why the turn in the Syrian conflict seems so uncannily familiar. It rhymes very strongly with the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in the 80s (which led, among other things, to the Kashmir insurgency). 

This is not a good rhyme.

        - Weird perspective effect, plane coming in for a landing looks like an A380 while one taking off looks like an A310 or something. So 260’ wingspan vs 144’. Almost 2x. Since they look about the same subtended angle when takeoff begins, the 380 is at least a runway length behind https://t.co/S8I4bLP5Bx

        - At the edge, “faster alone, farther together” breaks down because you don’t have the time. So there’s a strong temptation to break off from the herd and go farther alone in the time left.

            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183488686458957825
        - So you have a choice once you get to the edge. Accept a snails pace of further growth tracking shared understandings or move faster with less sharing but higher risk of deeper understanding being wrong. This is solipsistic dark growth.

        - By the time you get to some version of the species leading edge of self-understandings (there’s no consensus but it takes till around 40 to get to any of the edge nodes) you’re acutely aware that the line of scrimmage between us and universe  won’t move much more in your lifetime
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183486919943933952
        - Human understanding of the universe grows at a fairly slow rate, even with exponentially growing production of raw knowledge. We understand what it *means* much more slowly. 

So in say 80 years between birth and death human species-level self-understanding grows by maybe 1%...

        - @vgr this thread really closely parallels my "i'm turned 40" mental process. There's definitely a sense that what felt like a finish-line race in my 30s is transforming into a recognition that the style of my gait is the prize for having endured chaotic youth.

        - @humanleon I think all that is fulfillment not dark growth 

Growth to me has a distinctive signature of traumatic learning, and that you’re advancing the art of life just a little bit further. Some aspects of parenting and grand parenting and teaching have that but it is kinda narrow.

        - That’s kinda what 40+ life can feel like except that a) most people don’t even notice that there IS a different life stage b) a lot of people actually get confused and start thinking they should be actually taking tests and worrying about grades like they’re still in school
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183445755521990656
        - Imagine if at 30 you had 16 year olds constantly asking you about what grade you got on the test, taking your reticence to mean you got a bad grade because they don’t get that school ends and there’s a different life beyond,  and judging/shaming you loudly for not studying harder
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183445250380951552
        - I have this growing impatience with the framing of the 40+ life experience as “slowly failing youth” unless you’re in the minority that stays on an obvious extension of the under-40 script. It’s like this annoying fog obscuring the truly interesting life-stage challenges.

        - Of that 5%, the dark growth is visible to intimates in most cases, but rarely legible. So most intimate relationships are likelier to grow apart than grow together. 

Dem’s the odds. Divergence is the default, not convergence.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183442648834568192
        - Of the 15% who continue publicly legible growth, maybe 1% are growing in a generative way, while 14% are in arrested development, stuck in Act 1 ruts.

~85% stop visibly growing.

Of this, 80% stop growing, period.

But 5% are in “dark growth” visible+legible mostly to themselves

I think the lack of visible growth after 40 for the vast majority is a good thing. It means growth has gone past healthy solipsism horizon. They’re living life on their own terms.

        - Empirically people don’t really seem to grow much after 40. Maybe 1 in 10 will adopt a truly different mindset. Maybe 1 in 100 will develop a new life-shaping ability (not a hobby). Maybe 1 in 1000 will take on a fundamentally leveled-up Act 2 that will top Act 1.

Everybody seems to have a soft spot for a certain kind of charming con-man until they cross a line. What is that line, I wonder?

Interestingly Trump was never one. Before he was dangerous, he was unintentionally campy rather than charming.

        - It’s a common misconception that burnouts come from hard work. 

Burnout comes from a felt loss of control and/or impact.

Always remember that you can burn out employees (or yourself) with little to no work. https://t.co/B5QGPNtSPB

        - @k_aranke @Zedd @JohnCena @aamir_khan Sure. The point is, China's leverage relies on the idea that there are a lot more such people than there actually are.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183117913030418432
        - An actually reasonable alternative to liberal democracy + free markets would need to check 3 boxes:

1. A fractal feedback mechanism at least as strong as democracy

2. A basis for grand narratives beyond nation-state exceptionalism

3 A better software-eats world story than SV
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183117753655316480
        - @k_aranke @Zedd yeah, and taken in aggregate it is an effective signal to china that they don't in fact have as much leverage on the rest of the world as they think they do. I agree with you, I'm just pointing out a different implication.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183116357832830976
        - I'm increasingly skeptical of any "X with Chinese characteristics" claim... it tends to be a distinction without a difference. Mythopoetic cosmetology gloss over relatively mundane contextual variations.

        - I'd frankly welcome something good in this position of the spectrum. If the Dispatch is serious about this, they should hire Shepard Smith and activate him the moment his non-compete with Fox runs out. Center-right power move. https://t.co/w3dB8kRt58
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183115318765318144
        - @k_aranke Sure, but it also means that China is not as important as the CCP thinks it is, if a lot of people are able to do such low-cost signaling.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183112696218050560
        - @Aelkus @literalbanana Yeah and I find that interesting actually. For example, pacific octopus basically crawls into a hole and starves to death like Jains after it reproduces. The associated "inner life" in the human version is less interesting to me than the basic phenomenology of the behavior.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183112281762041856
        - @Aelkus @literalbanana Not yet sure what I'm looking for, but my general point is that existentialism, while definitely salient, misses the point in some deep way and that the essence of wrapping your mind around mortality lies elsewhere (rationality is just a starter cue)

        - @literalbanana @Aelkus Hence my fascination with mediocrity. A story that kinda half gets at what I'm sniffing around is Father Sergius, a sort of indictment of the self-consciously examined life in favor of the unexamined mediocre one. https://t.co/ykIbrw4nly
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183110327900131329
        - @literalbanana @Aelkus I got the sense he thought a life full of peak experiences and spiritual questing was somehow a much deeper religious experience, which I found a persuasive argument at the time (this was 20y ago so I've forgotten the book). Now I'm intrigued by the depth of "healthy mindedness"
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183109829826506753
        - @Aelkus @literalbanana Neither is determinative, but I argue that mortality is a necessary part of the explanation. You have to time such actions, and the timing reveals shifts in your mortality orientation. Kinda like suddenly getting into religion late in life does.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183109442373484545
        - @Aelkus @literalbanana I recall in William James' Variety of Religious Experiences, he starts with "the religion of healthy-mindedness" (basically normies with no deep spiritual leanings or introspective tendencies) and dismisses them quickly to move on to more "interesting" angsty varieties.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183108442422034432
        - @Aelkus @literalbanana it's only invalid if you think somehow extreme depressive angst or existential nausea is in some way a more "authentic" response... it is certainly an interesting response, arguably more interesting than dull estate planning, but I am not convinced it is more authentic

        - @literalbanana @Aelkus Subnormies read heidegger, normies try to figure out how to game taxes on their 401k and transfer property to kids in the sneakiest way possible. Revealed preference suggests the latter are in less denial about death.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183106993533308928
        - @literalbanana @Aelkus Normies are the only ones who are actually prepared to hear it ime. All subcultural types (including billionaire immortalists) are in some sort of denial bubble or the other, aestheticizing their mortality-salient cognitions with some pretty reification or the other.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183106452149268480
        - @context_ing One takeaway I got from hearing him speak at an event is that once your expected life horizon falls below 20y, you should switch to goal-directed thinking, and once you are terminal, you should set goals one day at a time.
            - https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1183106083650326528
        - @Aelkus @literalbanana Trick to applying vanilla-rationality to mortal-rationality questions is to get to interesting reductio ad absurdum conclusions that then free you up to think in more interesting ways. Pascal's wager, Sisyphus, etc. The starting point of mortal rationality is absurdity-nausea.
