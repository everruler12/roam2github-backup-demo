Sometimes you can run into a situation where you've got a bunch of pages with names like: ebooks, EBooks, eBooks, Ebooks.
Each of those pages may contain different data, but all of those pages refer to the same concept... ebooks. Annoying, right?
Well, there's actually a solution for tidying up all of these pages.
Let's try to merge together ebooks and EBooks into just "ebooks"
    1. Go to the EBooks page
    2. Click on the title to rename it
    3. Rename the page to ebooks
    4. An orange warning will ask you if you want to merge the two pages, click on the tick icon
    5. Done! Now all the data is merged :)
