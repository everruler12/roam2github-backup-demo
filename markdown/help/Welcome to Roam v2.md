- ## **Quick Start**
    There's very little to know to start using Roam.
        ### Everything is a block
            - **Each bullet you see is a __block__, and we write them inside pages like this one.**
                - We create new blocks by pressing `Enter`; and nest them using `Tab` (press`Shift+Tab` to unindent)-
                    - This creates __children blocks__, which we can expand, collapse, and focus. 
                    - Indenting provides structure. We can scan pages with ease and find related blocks. Try clicking the **·êÖ** icon on the next block!
        ### Everything is where you need it to be
            - **Organizing information is effortless with** [page]([[Page References]])/[block references]([[Block References]]).
                - Let's say we have a meeting. In our Daily Notes, we might write
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} Have a [[meeting]] with [[John Smith]] about [[Roam Research]] on [[February 8th, 2021]]. #marketing
                - Those square brackets turn text into **__backlinks__**.
                    - This automatically creates a page for each keyword--click the backlink to go the keyword's page. 
                    - At the bottom, you'll find instances where the page was mentioned--its __page references__.
                    - So the meeting reminder block appears on [[meeting]], [[John Smith]], [[marketing]], and [[Roam Research]]!
                    - This way, we never have to worry about which folder to file things in- just [[backlink]] as you go.
        ### Everything is a `/` away
            - Roam is packed with powerful features. Anytime you want to do more than type text,
                - just type `/` to bring up the inline command palette.
                    - If you don't find what you're looking for, click on the Help
                    -  icon in the top right of the page! If you can think it, you can do it in Roam.
