The [[Zettelkasten]] is basically the [[GTD]] for Intellectual Progress
    - It makes the unpredictable work of creative insight into a habit -- and makes it much much easier to write papers

                - When you're writing research papers or blog-posts you should never be starting with a blank page -- you instead want to just pull on a "thread" and have a whole stream of thoughts -- already written in complete sentences, in your own words, to build off of
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} Include link on threads from [[Visakan V]]'s twitter
                - Especially if you're doing a lot of interdisciplinary work, or if a lot of your work builds off similar ideas, these small chunks may be useful over and over again

Most of the people I know who follow the [[Zettelkasten]] process find existing writing / notes tools pretttttyyy limiting
    - Evidence::
        - Weaknesses of [[Notion]]
