- [[VladyslavSitalo]] hacked together a cloze deletion component using hiccup
    - because of way that :hiccup works, unfortunately have to use embed instead of just normal ref
        - This is the outer text {{embed: ((A_huWO2SB))}} and this is the rest of it
        - 
        - 
    - :hiccup [:span.cloze "I want this"]
    - Cloze block styling
        - :hiccup [:style  "span.cloze { background-color: #1f2b33 } span.cloze:hover {background-color: transparent}"]
