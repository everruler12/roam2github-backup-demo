            - sorting of [[y axis]] is based on [[time period]]
        - Notes on "Structure::"
            - "[[time period]]" is something that gets used multiple times
                - so it is clear that "Label" is actually the root of the entity - and the other information is just being added on top of it

        - Structure::
            - This one seems to more natively map to the structure of Tables already in Roam
                - but it would be good to be able to map these things into attributes - so that they'd be more easily queryable -- right now these tables are just a display - not a valuable structured data format
                - what is also great is that the same collection of [[People]] and[[time period]] are used in this chart as in [[To know me is to know my]]

            - {{embed: ((ECwiXThsJ))}}
                - The problem right now - conceptually - is that when I block ref something - I've been defaulting to thinking about referencing the LINK -- like - the whole connection between "[[Thoughts and Ideas]]" and that set of people
                    -  What I'm looking for in this "Version 2 " example is the ability to not just [REFERENCE]([[Block References]]) the attribute, but to reuse the relationship - in terms of the data structure
        - 12:03 -
            - can still view this whole thing as a table - but have to change the original thing to render the table layout
                - or would have to block-ref each individual item to add the whole table to the top - which wouldn't be reactive
                    - Would be nice if you could pass block-embed into something and have it actually treat it exactly the same way as if the items underneath were direct children of that block
        - 12:08 -
            - noticing that there is a relationship between each column where "[[18th Century]]" people are noticing problems with the the things "[[16th Century]]" where getting from "leading to ideas about::"
