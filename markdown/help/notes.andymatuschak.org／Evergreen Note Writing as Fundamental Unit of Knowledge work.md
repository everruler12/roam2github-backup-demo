    - # Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work
    - If you had to set one metric to use as a leading indicator for yourself as a knowledge worker, the best I know might be the number of [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) written per day. [Note-writing can be a virtuosic skill](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Note-writing_can_be_a_virtuosic_skill), but [Most people use notes as a bucket for storage or scratch thoughts](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Most_people_use_notes_as_a_bucket_for_storage_or_scratch_thoughts) and [Note-writing practices are generally ineffective](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Note-writing_practices_are_generally_ineffective).

    - If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing.
    - Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus.
    - Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything __as if nothing counts other than writing__.
