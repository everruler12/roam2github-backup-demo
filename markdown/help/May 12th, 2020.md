- [[Conor]]
    - Noticed that it was now over a year ago that I drafted a [[Tweet Storm]] about [[Thought Algorithm]]s in my personal Roam -- but I never got around to polishing it up -- literally haven't looked at it since, though it has been on the back of my mind that I should be out in the open - [[A Brief Rant on the Structure of Thought: Why Evernote is a Terrible Second Brain]]
        - I'm concerned I won't tweet it out in the near future, so putting it here 
            - [[Debugging Algorithms of Thought]]
                - I've noticed that some of the ideas that have felt most useful or powerful to me
                - What does Vipassana Meditation have in common with @tferriss 's approach to pareto optimum skill acquisition, Charlie Munger's Mental Models, @fortelabs building a second brain, Non-Violent Communication, and the Double Diamond Design Process, and critical path analysis?
                -  -- they're all instances of Thought algorithms -- 
                -  -- Higher order functions that abstract over a space of complex problems.
                    - I like thinking of them this way, because it is more obvious (to me) at least what is happening when I execute them than if I were to call them for instance "Strategies"
                - Theres a pattern here, I'm going to try to make clear -- and it makes more sense if you think about these procedures as functions
                - They take thoughts as input, and they tell you how to transform those thoughts into new thoughts
                - But they're multi-step -- you take a stream of inputs, transform them (mapping over them, filterig them)
                - The big benefit to having a receipe 
                - 
                - A few years ago, I got particularly excited about a particular class of these thought algorithms -- the ones that relate to effectively learning a new field
                    - Tim Ferriss' approach was a big inspiration 
                        - He convinced me that, in following the right algorithm, you could dramatically accelerate the path to mastering some skill
                        - I think these algorithms are particularly popular for auto-didacts, because (when you're entering a space of unknown) like learning a new field, it is especially important to feel like you have a plan you can trust.
                        - If at every step of the way, you're wondering (am I wasting my time), or doubting the activity you're doing, then you're much more likely to give up.
                        - At the same time, its true that if you go about learning something "the wrong way", its incredibly easy to waste your time and not make much progress.
                    - Tim Ferris's gave sort of an existence proof that (if you followed the right algorithm for learning a new skill), you could have potentially orders of magnitude better results than taking a conventional approach. [[DiSSS or D3S Method]]
                        - Deconstruction:  Break the skill into smallest learnable units
                            - He had fantastic hacks for deconstruction -- like finding a world class performer who lacked the "natural talent" and thus you could expect would have had to find the true "fundamentals", particularly one who was no longer in the spotlight, and then interview them
                        - Selection:  Select the units that have the highest return
                            - 1000 words make up like 80% of the writing in a language (focus on those, and the words that matter to the domain you care about)
                        - Sequence: Identify the right order to learn the thing
                            - If you learn the 100 words that are most important for conversing and asking questions, you can get to a place where practice is both enjoyable, and something you can do all the time.
                    - I found a number of other algorithms for this -- my favorite being
                        - Scholarship: How to do it effectively 
                            - Which taught me both how to download textbooks for free, and convinced me that finding the best textbook (as a starting point) was completely worth it, compared with trying to piece together information from blog posts and youtube videos (those are excellent supplements, but not the fastest way to build a scaffold)
                    - Probably the most influential for me though was Mortimer Adler's How to Read a Book
                        - His algorithm is for how to extract knowledge from a text
                            - Read the table of contents
                            - Read the index
                            - Read the introduction and conclusion
                            - Skim the book, (focusing on places where they author is summarizing their thoughts or spelling out key definitions (like the introduction and conclusion)
                            - Spend 80% (my number) of your time, on the truly great books that will stretch you -- give you new ontologies -- that have ideas worth grabbling with and presented as clearly as is possible for the idea.  
                            - Definitely don't worry about finishing all the books you've read
                            - Look for key questions, arguments, and terms
                            - Pull the author into conversation with the other authors on the topics (try and figure out where they agree and disagree)
                        - Try and map out their [[Ontology]] and underlying world view
                    - [[Junto Research Clubs]]
                        - I got so hooked on this idea, that at one point I organized a bunch of "peer to peer research groups" where we would all follow this algorithm (sort of a hybrid of Adler's process and Ferriss)
                        - We created a standard process for how to Deconstruct the things we were trying to learn -- a way of approximating what the best sources would be,  selecting the most significant units, and sequence learning those units so we could gain mastery faster
                        - Goal obviously not being to cut corners -- but to focus on what is most relevant and fundamental -- if you can learn more efficiently, you can learn more, and thus bring together ideas from different fields 
                        - Obviously this was the sort of thing best done as a group (if you're exploring a new domain, and expect that some units -- which you don't know in advance, are going to be MUCH higher leverage than others, you want each person to go off and explore on their own -- then the group to exploit the best opportunites that each individual finds, and then do the same for each new domain that opens up based on your new knowledge)
                        - We more of a focus on stakes (you had to pay $40 if you skipped the meeting, or failed to complete your reading and breaking down your book)
                - I've noticed that this framework in particular [[Pareto Principle]] -- [[Collaborative Explore-Exploit]] has really shaped my worldview and directed my work. Also though, just noticing the impact of this [[Thought Algorithm]] has sort of kept me cued up to find other ones (and has motivated me to look for better ways of working with them)
                    - Related [[The World Makes Sense. That is why we can have nice things.]]
                - Other examples I mention above 
                    - #Double Diamond Design Process
                    - Might not use this one
                        - #Points of Leverage in a System
                    - #Byron Katie's The Work
                        - [[Byron Katie]] is particularly powerful -- I used it once, sort of thing that I used once to solve a major relationship conflict -- had a similar experience with [[NVC]], but then noticed that I (while I didn't follow it so exactly in the future), it subtly shifted a lot.  Like other algorithms, its the sort of thing that worked incredibly well, but took effort, and didn't follow exactly again after, but showed me this different frame that then adjusted things subtly in the future
                    - All the techniques taught at [[CFAR]], and the whole research space
                        - [[Double Crux]], [[Internal Family Systems]]
                    - It opened me up to ideas like the one from [[Plato]], that [[There is no such thing as willpower, we just implement whatever we believe to be the best strategy]]
                        - And as a result, when you're having motivation issues (or procrastination issues), it is due to some set of underlying beliefs
                            - Some part of you believes that staying up until 4am playing Sid Meir's Civilization is the best use of your time, or yelling at your partner is the best way of getting your needs met, or beating yourself up about failure is the only way to ensure future success/acceptance/love/safety -- and that this conflict in your mind is the root of you "getting in your own way".
                - Which is to say -- the belief in thought algorithms (in general) lead me to pay particular attention to ones that look promising, and these have (I believe) pretty fundamentally shaped who I am (and how I interact with the world).  But as I said -- this "belief" in [[Thought Algorithm]]s (particularly in conjunction with my belief around [[Collaborative Explore-Exploit]]) also has inspired my work.  It lead me to building a non-linear writing tool.  Why?
                    - Note -- I'm motivated to share this due to [[Simon Syneak]] Thought Algorithm of [[Start With Why]], and I feel fine sharing this arguably self-promoting idea due to [[Gary Vanderchuck]]'s idea of [[Jab Jab Hook]]
                    - For one -- due to a problem I ran into when i was [[Do things that don't scale]] in by running those peer to peer research groups [[Junto Research Clubs]]
                    - So -- what was the problem?
                        - Well, in the aforementioned research club -- we were following a particular process.  << [[JRC-Process]]
                            - Identify possible sources
                            - Filter for best guess at best sources
                                - We would search sub-reddits (particularly for things like, best way to learn arabic characters)
                                - [[The Best Textbook on Every Subject]]
                            - Each person takes a book
                            - Deconstruct the book, using [[Analytic Reading]]
                                - [[Meta]] -- [[Todos]] -- the hover effect on [[Autocomplete]] makes it look like something is selected when it isn't -- might be the problem [[Carson Jones]] was running into
                                - Find Questions, Terms, Statements
                            - Map the ideas together
                                - Find out what questions are related -- useful framework here [[Make Just One Change]]
                            - When searching for an answer in [[Theoretical Books]]
                                - Assess argument structure first
                                - Try to [[Steelman]] arguments and pass the author's [[Ideological Turing Test]]
                            - When trying to develop a skill from [[Practical Books]]
                                - Do something like [[DiSSS or D3S Method]]
                            - If you're curious -- here's one of the worksheets I put together for facilitating of these 
                                - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fC3u5Wya_r2vs7uFrAuFRhtzp_4fiUsTn1y7limmlqQ/edit
                                    - Note -- this is from 2013
                                - [[Slide Deck]] of [[How to Read A Book]]     
                                    - https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L-wnqfvtgW2gFWH6X1nMLqe5xVo7m0y00mFWokVJXnw/edit#slide=id.g9f1720b0d_2_43
                        - I noticed that the algorithm I was trying to run was obvious to me (I wrote it)-- but even though I knew the plan, it was still really helpful to have a scaffold
                            - When I set [[Pomodoro]] timers, and had the process written out (somewhat in the form of a worksheet) -- it was much easier to manage my attention
                        - This was doubly true when other people were trying to both [[Learn the Process]] and execute it at the same time.
                            - We had sub-process for each stage (deciding how to frame the question, finding sources, analyzing sources, building a learning path, following the path)
                        - There is a reason that [[Byron Katie]] provides an ACTUAL [[Worksheet]]
                            - I think this is supported by [[Andy Clark]]'s ideas of [[Extended Cognition]] and [[David Kirsch]]'s ideas of [[The Intelligent Use of Space]]
                            - You can focus all your attention on the task in front of you
                            - You don't have to worry about remembering what you're doing next
                            - Thus it is easier to maintain momentum -- especially on cognitively difficult tasks.  
                                - You're able to project manage yourself
                        - Beyond just helping people have less cognitive overhead while doing an inherently difficult thing (exploring a new field) it was also much much easier for people to collaborate and learn from each other's research, and build on each other's work when we were all following a similar enough process
                        - So, what I ended up doing was creating a sort of [[Workflowy]] [[Templates]]

                                                                - 1.  -------
                                                        - [[Meta]] -- [[Todos]] -- [[Styling]] -- We should introduce [[Workflowy]] type grid-lines, when the dots are in view, and in that re-factor, also have option of turning off bullet-points from view.  -- could also refactor so not in a tree, but that's probably too much of a stretch
                            - You might be able to guess at the obvious problems with using a structure like that
                                - Workflowy was great for input -- but the structure of the information we were trying to collect was really poorly suited to a tree (particularly for the things we wanted to do, AFTER we collected out the key ideas)
                                    - Remember, the next steps after [[DS3: Deconstruction]] are [[DS3: Selection]] and [[DS3: Sequencing]]
                                    - The same question or concept for example was being addressed in multiple places throughout the book -- (during reading, we often wanted to break things down by chapter), but then you also wanted to relate the questions to each other, and filter out most important questions in a book for sharing with other people on the team
                                    - There was this [[Many to Many]] relationship between questions claims and terms, and chapters -- even just within the same book -- and Workflowy didn't represent that.  
                                        - You could use links to point to different parts of the tree using links -- but those links only worked in one direction (similar to [[Quote-tweet]]s) -- so you'd have to put 2x as many links if you wanted to be able to go from high-level questions to detailed questions and move back.
                                    - The problem only got worse when you were trying to connect ideas across books and resources
                            - This is possibly a strange problem to run into -- the only other person I've seen who has run into this exact problem was someone who supervised a team of researchers who were reading medical papers and trying to create custom [[Meta-analysis]]es for [[Rare Diseases]].
                                - Their goal was to help clients make sense of a bunch of hard-to-parse research data and make suggestions on what interventions would actually be appropriate
                                    - Probably not a coincidence -- this is also the person who has gotten most exited about the tool we've been building.
                                        - [[Sarah Constantin Endorsement]]
                                    - They also found that lack of good tooling for this problem made their project far more difficult to execute on -- and despite having a really stellar team, and substantial funding -- that bottleneck looks like it may have broken some of the economics needed to make the project really viable. 
                            - I also found that -- not having good tools for taking the following steps beyond Deconstruction really made me question the worthiness of continuing down the path using Workflowy.  
                                - The quotes we were collecting, summaries we were writing, and links we were drawing was all clearly DATA -- but when there was very little we could do with the data -- (besides just read and think) -- it was much harder to justify the extra effort.
                                    - 
                            - I looked at what we were trying to do (and the pattern of [[Thought Algorithm]]s in general) and clearly there was some abstract problem to solve here -- so the obvious answer (to a tech bro) -- write some software! $$\red{\text{A}}$$
                                - [[Learning to Code Backstory]]
                                    - Problem then -- I had been a mostly non-technical CEO, and was more than a bit traumatized over sale of my first company (CTO had lost faith in vision and in me, so had to sell to get a soft-landing (first world problem sure -- but had really felt like selling out and triggered huge amount of self-loathing/imposter syndrome))
                                    - I also felt like I needed to walk-the-talk of this whole [[DiSSS or D3S Method]] of [[DS3: Deconstruction]] deconstructing knowledge -- and at the time I was running these research groups (later condensed to 8 hour "Learnathon" meetups) -- the hard thing everyone wanted to learn was web-development.
                                    - So, obvious answer was -- STFU and deconstruct web-development until I was a skilled enough engineer for really skilled people to actually want to work with.  -- Biggest fear was being pointy headed boss from Dilbert. (Also lit says people only like working for people who could actually do their job)
                                        - Also -- try and figure out character flaws that caused first CTO to lose faith in me in the first place.
                                    - Result of that process brought me to [[Clojurescript]] and starting [[CLJRC]] 
                                        - I found, what I perceived and perceive to be the 20% that produced highest gains -- datalog, and then found experts in that community -- provided value to them by connecting them to each other -- and giving them a [[Thought Algorithm]] of [[Hamming Questions]] and the [[The Art of Science and Engineering]] "If you know what you're doing in Science, you shouldn't be doing it"
                                        - Selection got me focused on the ideas of [[Bret Victor]] and [[Doug Engelbart]] -- and learning design
                                            - 
                    - So -- what are the abstract problems? from $$\red{\text{A}}$$
                        - See [[Thought Vectors]] tweet from [[Samim]]
                        - 1. Template -- I want to be able to specify a structure (particularly of questions I'm going to ask)
                            - Should be able to specify up front a [[Thought Algorithm]] -- a plan that you are going to go through
                                - Each step in the algorithm requires thinking -- but there were some generic structures (similar to programming concepts)
                                    - For example
                                        - [[Brainsort]] for [[Sort a [[List]]]]
                                        - [[Deslider]] for [[Reduce]]
                                - In my case -- its the selection of material, the deconstruction of the material, filtering, and then sequencing
                                - You should be able to focus on each step -- one a time (so you don't overwhelm working memory)-- but still have it fit into the overall structure, and be able to use the output of each steps in other steps
                                - Those higher level steps being things like -- combining and comparing ideas with each other [[Reduce]], filtering out certain things [[Filter]], and generating new lists from applying a new question to the result of a previous operation [[Map]].
                                - [[Mapping Question]] -- [[Map]]
                                    - I knew for example -- I'd ask a question, the answer to that question would be a list -- for each item in the list I'd then ask a different question 
                                        - (I might want to filter the list, or sort the list, or generate a new list by applying another question (or relation) over the old list)
                                    - -- and on and on --  basically, I wanted to "map" a question over a sequence of thoughts to generate a new sequence, then map another question over that sequence
                                - The key thing though is -- I wanted to see where each new thought had come from -- and also be able to use each thought in multiple different algorithms. $$\red{\text{3}}$$
                        - 2. I want the results from one process to feed into other ones
                            - If I have a list of people I respect, and for each of them I've found out their favorite book on the topic -- I want to be able to take that list of books from all those people, filter by topic etc.
                        - $$\red{\text{3}}$$  I wanted to be able to show others (and myself) Algorithm, and the intermediate results -- sort of like a step-through debugger (and I wanted the whole chain to be reactive to updates at any part of the process)
                            - For instance -- If I have filtered a list of say "potential features for an app" based on some criteria like "technical feasibility", and my evidence for removing a feature from the list was based on some mistaken belief, I wanted someone else (or my future self), to be able to update that belief, and then have the feature be added back to the list of potential features.
                            - Similarly, if I felt that something was true, and my argument for believing it was based on a research paper that later failed to replicate -- or was invalidate by another paper or argument, I wanted my future self (or a trusted collaborator) to be able to update the claim and all beliefs based on that one get flagged.
                        - 4. I wanted a tool that reflected both the Hierarchy of Ideas, and the underlying network
                            - Quotes are part of books -- but the ideas they express are connected with all the ideas in all the books (and even your hierarchical structure should be fluid -- so you could organize books by author and by topic, and by things like what beliefs they've updated you on)
                            - Arguments have a logical structure -- even if they aren't [[Deductive]], they still have some [[Probabilistic]] influence on one another
                            - Ideas also have [[Terms]], which authors use in different ways, so I want to be able to do thinks like [[Replace the Term with the Definition]] 
                            - If I have to copy and paste ideas all over the place, I lose the structure of the thoughts, its harder to [[Compose]] ideas -- build them up from one another. 
                        - 5. I wanted a tool that deals with irregularly shaped data
                            - Workflowy and [[Wiki]]s are great for this
                                - You can always just add another bullet for meta commentary or to follow a thought in some other direction
                            - [[Table]]s are bad for this
                                - Hard to annotate the value of a cell
                                - When comparing some dissimilar items -- end up having to have columns for the set of all attributes on all the items -- leads to really hard to read tables.
                        - 6. I want a UI that helps me focus my attention on exactly the part of the problem I'm going through at that moment
                            - [[Concept Maps]] and [[Mind Maps]]
                            - [[Workflowy]]
                            - [[Worksheet]]s and [[Typeform]]
                            - [[Annotations]] in [[Document Mode]]
                            - [[Table]]s and [[Faceted Search]] for comparing collections
                            - [[Filter]]s
                    - Where are we at now -- [[Private]]
                        - 
                - From [[Conversation]] with [[Michael Merchant]]
                    - First thing you do in [[Brainstorm]]ing meeting is to brainstorm the [[Prompts]]
                        - Example of a question that generates more question
                            - Similar to [[Make Just One Change]]
                        - [[Workflowy]], [[Excel]], [[Plectica]] -- [[Mind Maps]], [[Google Docs]] are all input devices for getting thoughts out of your head, and turning those thoughts into data [[Input Devices]]
                            - Problem is, there is nothing you can do with that data afterwords
                            - Each of those is good for different kinds of things -- each of those things they're good for is useful for a different part of the thinking process
                            - What is needed is a way of creating Streams of data transformation -- where the transformation is something you are doing with your mind (like answering a brainstorming prompt -- or comparing objects, or ranking options), and the whole pipeline is visible -- and reactive to changes you make at each step of the process.
                            - You want to be able to "play computer" with yourself -- to step through the algorithm, to reuse the results of each step for other operations, and have changes flow upstream and downstream.

                - I'll start with one of my favorite examples of a thought algorithm -- Scholarship: How to Do it Effectively
                - They take one or more thoughts as input, and then run a transformation on those thoughts to bring you to the next step
                    - This is one of my favorite examples
