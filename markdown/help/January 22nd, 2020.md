        - background info related to [[Block References]]/[[Block Mentions]]
            - currently if I have an external resource that I want to add my own commentary to, the work flow is like this
                - I create a page for that source - like [[The Refragmentation]] then I use a block reference on the paragraph I want to comment on
                - I can use alt-drag on a bullet point to create a reference to a paragraph on the daily note page
                    - "Business owners weren't supposed to be making money either. FDR said "not a single war [[millionaire]]" would be permitted. To ensure that, any increase in a company's profits over prewar levels was taxed at 85%. And when what was left after corporate taxes reached individuals, it was taxed again at a marginal rate of 93%.Â [[2](http://paulgraham.com/re.html#f2n)] {{comment-button}}"
                        - then I can put my comment here -- and I get a footnote on the paragraph showing that this has been referenced somewhere else
                    - when I am on the actual page -- I can view the comments by zooming into a block as well
                - problems are
                    - this workflow requires that you know a shit ton about how Roam works
                        - other people commenting on your document won't know this
                    - other problem is that block-mentions - especially on big blocks, is filled with visual noise.
            - constraints
                - We want [[Commenting]] be basically normal blocks
                    - so that
                        - they can be referenced - and embedded in other pages -- for [[Meta-analysis]] or meta conversations
                        - they can be commented on
                        - they can include things like tags and filters
                - [[Commenting]] has some specific problems though
                    - On an individual comment
                        - time is possibly very relevant -- might want to automatically include a link to the day
                        - comments should only be editable by the user who created them
                        - we want to very clearly see who the comment is - so name and display icon should feature prominently -- might want a page associated with each email address on a workspace 
                        - Comments should probably not be nested underneath the block that you're commenting on -- better to nest them on a block reference to the block, and to put that on either a page like [[Roam/Comments]] or on the daily notes page.
                    - The [[Comment Section]] on a block
                        - might want to be able to aggregate that by paged, so you could see all the comments on a
