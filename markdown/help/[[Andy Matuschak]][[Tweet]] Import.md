        - @gwern @[[michael_nielsen]] I should also mention that we dropped all durations greater than 50 seconds in that analysis, to try to remove obvious idling outliers. Those were &lt;2% of samples, iirc

        - @gwern @[[michael_nielsen]] If it is minutes, that would be pretty consistent! It’s hard for me to imagine that the overwhelming majority of your reviews would be completed in less than one second. I wonder if it also tracks seconds, if my guess is right.

        - @howtodowtle That’s helpful feedback, thank you. We recently made the schedule much more aggressive in part to help with this. Do you recall when you tried it? I would be curious if it still felt annoying with the new schedule.

        - Instinctively, I suspect the retry behavior is likely worth keeping around as an emotionally important element. More interviews will help us understand that. But there's a time cost to retrying, so we'll want to replace/augment it with something better if we can!
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1204465774762446848
        - OK, a few pp, but those intervals overlap. And actually, the confidence is likely a bit overstated, since there'll be within-user correlations of samples. I'd guess it'll resolve to 2-3pp.

It'd be nice to have &gt;80% accuracies for lapsed q's. We'll need stronger interventions!
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1204465774192025600
        - It seems to helps a little… but not as much as I expected!

Considering questions forgotten after a 2 week break, how likely were those q's to be forgotten next time (a few days later)?

With retry: 79 ±4.1% (N=375)
Without retry: 74 ±1.8% (N=2347)
(95% ci's assume binomial iid)
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1204465773642579968
        - In September we added a "retry" step to Quantum Country. If you forget something, you'll review it again later that session.

Other systems do something like this, and interviews suggested that readers needed to feel seen+supported when forgetting.

Does it help accuracy? (con't) https://t.co/ChpK5YdLmK

        - @wcrichton Yep, they strike me as a good example. A bit narrow—you can't really fit "a whole note" in that design pattern—but good for many types of things!
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202665974790381569
        - What are the best examples and design patterns of peripheral vision in software interfaces?
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663259536408577
        - If I read an old digital note, I get the unnerving sense that it’s part of some “whole” that I can’t see at all—no matter how much hypertext is involved. Working with physical notes, I’d shuffle notes around to make sense of the structure. There isn’t a digital equivalent.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663258827542529
        - Backlinks are a weak peripheral vision, and they help, but they’re generally about switching the one note you have open, not an effective means of sense-making across many notes. Contextual backlinks help, but if you navigate, you lose object permanence.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663258131353601
        - Most systems barely support multiple windows, but even if I can open multiple windows, it’s awkward to arrange them into the spatial relationships I might naturally use for physical index cards. Rather than peripheral vision, it’s like I’m wearing horse blinders and mittens. https://t.co/1akRdeFfv2
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663256143187968
        - In digital note systems, the UI centers on the experience of writing one note. The core operations and representations fixate on “the note you have open,” not on larger structures. I often can’t simultaneously see another note I’ve just finished writing—let alone the last four.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663245426749440
        - The primary “unit” in such systems is a single highlight or note, but that’s not how I think. Marginalia have fuzzy boundaries, and I often think of a page’s markings as a single unit.

LiquidText is a lovely counterexample: it works hard to display annotations in context. https://t.co/A5rz26mppH
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663243023560704
        - Peripheral vision offers context.

If I mark up a physical book then later flip through to see my margin notes, I’ll always see them in the context of the surrounding text. By contrast, digital annotation listings usually display only the text I highlighted, removed from context. https://t.co/OLlkjLpipe
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663218553868288
        - If I leave books lying on my coffee table, I’ll naturally notice them at receptive moments. I'll read a book if I feel an actual, concrete interest in it. By contrast, the motivation to read a digital book comes from abstract interest in the habit of reading.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663213034196993
        - Peripheral vision emphasizes the concrete.

Unread digital books and papers live in some folder or app, invisible until I decide that “it’s reading time.” But that confuses cause and effect. https://t.co/3iHuLIEZYq
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663211817783296
        - Peripheral vision spontaneously prompts action.

If I need to fix a door, I’ll be reminded each time I see it. Digital task lists live in a dedicated app. I have no natural cause to look at that app regularly, so I need to establish a new habit to explicitly review my task list.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1202663208059691009
        - Software interfaces undervalue peripheral vision! (a thread)

My physical space is full of subtle cues. Books I read or bought most recently are lying out. Papers are lying in stacks on my desk, roughly arranged by their relationships. https://t.co/ee7lo0mdLv

        - Seems we're a long way from catechism, but hey, this one has a similar flavor:
Q: What is your Name?
A: …
Q: Who gave you this Name?
A: My Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptism; wherein I was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven.

        - These are all narrow examples of spaced repetition as more general "[[Programmable Attention]]." More exotic systems can be used to schedule arbitrary fine-grained tasks associated with some new identity, like iteratively reaching out to interesting people in a new field.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584310488354822
    - 
        - You can imagine creating cards about new habits (“Think of a new concrete situation in which I’ll have trouble leaving space for others to speak.”) or values (“What’s an unusual recent situation in which you thought on the century scale?”).

        - Sticking with quantum for the moment, one example might be: “At this instant, what unsolved question do I instinctively find most fascinating in quantum computing?” (nothing on the back). If you saw that regularly over months, would you identify with that space more deeply?
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584308475092992
        - That’s all indirect: changing identity by memorizing details associated with that identity. But maybe you can use these systems to alter your identity more directly.

        - Some questions I'll see for the 20th time and answer by rote, with no emotional connection at all to the original source. Other times I’ll find myself wondering new questions about the topic, feeling gradually more “in contact with” that topic over time.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584306608648193
        - With spaced repetition, you’re not just "a person who read that essay that one time": the repeated engagement may make you feel you're a “student of that topic,” in some more continuous sense. The tail might wag the dog.

I'll confess that my own experiences here are mixed.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584305694220290
        - Likewise, spaced-repetition helps people remember concrete material, but it also triggers re-engagement across time. Great: maybe readers will spot new connections when they return after a few weeks.

But maybe that repetition also fosters a change in identity!
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1201584304716963840
        - A typical example of a catechism:
Q1: What is the chief end of man?
A1: Man’s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him for ever.

At the surface, catechisms are about memorizing doctrine. But they also effect a change in *identity* through repeated exposure.

        - @DavidSHolz @jasoncbenn @tayroga @JvNixon @jeremyhoward I buy that. "Unlinked references" in [[@RoamResearch]] already seem somewhat valuable. It's easy to imagine increasing their value by e.g. using vector embeddings to "fuzz" the edges of that set. Not clear how soon that would come up on an oracular pri-queue relative to design work.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199751318312607745
        - @DavidSHolz @jasoncbenn @tayroga @JvNixon @jeremyhoward My instinct is unfashionable: rather than worrying so much about ranking and algorithms, worry a lot about info arch and presentation so you can approximate “see everything all the time”. The challenge is to do that usefully—everyone just starts drawing force-directed graphs.

        - @wayfarerish Not yet. It’s funny; I’m not sure which direction I’d want the sign to be. I’m actually more interested in “weird” connections much of the time!
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199503853198036992
        - @DavidSHolz It's fuzzy. Backlinks themselves are one piece of what I think of as "peripheral vision"—serendipitous representations of structure and associations. A high rank tells me that a note is implicitly "near" another note that's important along some axis (not always the axis I want).
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199401342160138241
        - @itsarnavb Ah, that's interesting. Concretely, how do you express the relevance of a backlink in the editing experience?
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199394617491251200
        - This morning I implemented PageRank to sort backlinks in my prototype note system. Mixed results!

＋: Easier to navigate to implicit "neighbor" notes connected via "hub" notes
＋: Surprises me notice how "central" some notes are
－: "Weird" backlinks often end up at the bottom
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1199378287555829760
        - @farrarscott Yeah, I mean, to some extent that's e.g. https://t.co/nF8VOcKM53 and sites like this. Try resizing the browser all the way from desktop-monitor down to mobile. Even the figures adapt…
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1198630760523022339
        - (Speaking of page numbers, most of them will renumber all the pages if you resize the window, even if the EPUB includes a canonical page mapping! The software situation is so poor that I convert ebooks to PDF—not to improve the layout, but to get *slightly* better reading tools!)
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1198269613357715456
        - (For that matter, there seems to be no serious desktop EPUB viewer of any kind. Set aside @patrickc-style dreams of doing anything interesting: none even lets you store annotations in some accessible format, view more than one (non-neighbor) page at once, or link to a page)
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1198269612707569664
        - With effort, you can download the book as a parallel EPUB and PDF (representing the two formats), then but you lose the ability to switch back and forth.

EPUB 3 includes "multiple renditions," which would let you combine both in one file… but no viewer supports this 2015 spec.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1198269612002955264
        - It's nice to use the typical ebook "flowing" mode when on small devices or when doing book-wide search operations; it's nice to use the original page layout in almost all other cases. Buuuuuut: Google Play's books are only viewable on desktop in a web viewer. No dice.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1198269611302457344
        - All major ebook formats and viewers are unpleasant and unimaginative, but one little joy: Google Play's ebooks are (usually) viewable in both the typical shapeless "flowing" mode and *also* original page layouts. Better: they have page mappings, so you can switch back and forth! https://t.co/00mfcGWL1W

        - @qualmist Not as written, but one typical issue (resolved by following this advice) is that the center of your pan may heat up much more quickly than the rest, which can cause real problems. Common with steel-based cookware (low conductivity, high density) and cheap burners.

        - @abhisharma_b @Ben_Reinhardt Hm! Of course the most important content in a new node is the original insight it contains, marginal to all other notes in the system. So something like this seems only useful at its limit as a bootstrapping mechanism.

        - @redblobgames Indeed! I was really struck, though, by how enormous a difference it makes to have the backlinks show the *context*. A list of links is pretty impenetrable; a list of *sentences*, though...
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190281973769498624
        - @Ben_Reinhardt It's interesting to think about the relevance angle here—something you reference a lot is clearly important to you, even if you haven't written anything on it explicitly. But this is more akin to saying a website is partially implicitly defined by the websites that link to it.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190105365012041734
        - Those backlinks provide kindling for writing the "proper" content of the node later. Seems important for the system to display the backlinks' *context:* a simple list of backlinks won’t implicitly define a node very effectively. Gotta see the context around the link.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190102758763855873
    - 
        - I first noticed this watching @Conaw use Roam. As he took notes on our chats, he made certain noun phrases (e.g. my name, named theories) into node links. Those nodes had no content of their own, but after a few days, they developed an implicit definition through the backlinks.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1190102758164066304
        - Knowledge systems which display contextual backlinks to a node open up an interesting new behavior. You can bootstrap a new node extensionally (rather than intensionally) by simply linking to it from many other nodes—even before it has any content.

        - On a personal level, that idea was the emotional core of the piece for me. I've really struggled with my relationship to design.

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1182497781841154049
        - @michael_nielsen Modern design practice demands deep engagement with users' context: interviewing, embedding, reading, empathizing. Such a powerful discipline… yet it's hard to shake the sense that the people creating profound tools for thought are doing all those things—somehow way more deeply.

        - @patio11 OK, so I know: It's A Joke. But! I enjoyed reflecting on the question—it's really so distinct from other American food! I guess I see its influences most clearly from Nouvelle cuisine, interpreted via Alice Waters and co in California, then with growing international influences.

        - @seligerj I have! I'm enthusiastic about associative personal knowledge management systems. My approach has some overlap with the principles described there, but because I'm more interested in manually-curated associations than machine-generated ones, I use a different tool.

        - @devonzuegel In Liguria, the primary region for pesto, the basil (and hence the pesto) tastes quite different from what we grow. Much sweeter, less resinous, more minerally. I was surprised to learn that the Genovese basil is DOP and has special inspectors!

        - @context_ing I think FSNotes has a lot of potential—in some sense more than Bear. I went with Bear because FSNotes:
* has no support for multiple windows (?!)
* has no autocomplete for wiki-style links
* is significantly less polished

These things are all fixable, since it's OSS. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        - @context_ing @marcinignac I think it's important to set forward links manually. I'm less sure about back links. I find myself manually setting back links in many cases, often in some appropriate inline spot.

Right now I present auto-backlinks in a secondary fashion, demarking their limited status.

        - @context_ing I tried using Notion for Zetteling, but the performance friction was too high. Want to open several notes in multiple windows? Hope you're ready to wait several seconds for each one to open. Currently using Bear, which is working well for now.

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147933110731857920
        - @joshu It's interesting thinking about navigational histories vs. Bush's associative trails. The former are implicit and much more explicit; the latter explicit and require work. Sometimes a straight timeline would be basically the same and way cheaper; other times very different…
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147932586737459200
        - @amyhoy Neat! I look forward to seeing. That latter point does seem to be true more often than I'd like, unfortunately.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147932214354575361
        - @joshu Neat! What was the motivation / framing?

I'm not sure I'd want to explicitly order materials (I could do that with files now, I guess, and I don't!)—more like I want to see something about how these things relate. eg. if it's 30 papers, were 28 of them references I found from 2?
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147931736182935552
        - Are there any good analyses of the structural reasons why we’re here and not there? Key problems with associative linking as attempted in past large-scale systems, etc? Other interesting attempts besides Xanadu? LiquidText is neat; fun to imagine OS-level adaptations… [fin]
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928391435186182
        - Bush also describes how you could acquire trails from others—another notion we’re missing. Others’ trails could be applied to materials you already have, so you could see a colleague’s associative structures alongside your own, on the same files.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928390826991616
        - But tags and folders are just sets. The structure is unordered, but your associations usually aren’t. It’s not just a theoretical problem: tags/folders are jumbled messes after a couple dozen items. Probably certain files are higher “degree,” but you’ll never know.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928390113955840
        - OS-level tags solve a problem Bush observes: that indexing systems usually assume there’s a “best” categorization of an item, but they often have many associations. You want many-to-many. But tagging a 100-page PDF or a 100-comp PSD isn’t very helpful. Memex links are page-level!
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928389468053505
    - 
        - If you want to arrange your own works relative to a disparate collection of others’ works, modern OSes offer folders and tags instead of links. In many cases, these are better: many associations form a clique or a tree, not a trail as Bush emphasizes.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928388851490816
        - Bush also suggested that this web of links wouldn’t just be between others’ published works—that subordinates your own work to others’. Your own materials (drawings, drafts, voice recordings, etc) are also stops on the associative “trail.”
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928388272709632
        - And of course, even that’s just the web. What about associations between pages of an ebook and a paragraph of a PDF? Between an email from a colleague and some drawings it reminded me of?
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928387698081792
        - Bush’s associations are bidirectional, while web links are one-way. I suspect bidirectional links make much more sense in a personal context than in contexts where all links must be shared by all; that may be part of why the web’s have stayed unidirectional.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928387152838657
        - Some people think this observation means Bush predicted the wiki. Yes, on a wiki, you can add a link to the text yourself… but that link would appear for _everyone._ There’s no notion of _personal_ associative markup.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928386091618304
        - Bush recognized that we think associatively. He thought we’d amplify creative work by building and navigating associative trails across materials. Many see this as predicting the WWW, but on a web site, you can only consume the links the author put there; you can’t add your own.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1147928385420554240
        - When I first read As We May Think* as a teenager, I was astonished by how much it predicted of the computer age in 1945—but recently I’ve been feeling wistful about some pieces it predicts which never came to pass. [thread]

        - Sitting comfortably and pondering an idea (without much writing) is less directed than writing but more directed than many of the others; it’s easy to maintain threads, but maybe not for hours. Feels a little more distant from the problem than writing, which can be helpful.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390837542084609
        - Just being bored, sitting somewhere, can be comparatively quite generative: helpful thoughts might arise which would feel too off-topic to pursue otherwise! Or I might just end up with a more expansive mental state, to be deployed in one of the other methods.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390836887740416
        - Long solo contemplative walks have low stakes—maybe lower than in conversation—but can linger somewhat longer on a single thread than might be socially comfortable in a conversation. It’s easier to just zone out, though, which might or might not be helpful.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390836220846080
        - Conversation will jump between more threads; it’s rare to focus on one idea for hours. But it may be more generative both because it’s less focused and because it involves others. The stakes for making progress often feel lower than for writing… which can be either good or bad.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390835616890880
        - Writing is fairly directed, good for maintaining a train of thought for long periods. The “scratchpad” of writing-so-far supports flimsy working memory, allowing more constituent thoughts to be juggled in synthesis. It’s a bit easy to iterate on something specific.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1141390834903818245
        - OK yes: it’s hard to hear yourself think; writing is a great way to isolate and sharpen ideas. But so’s a long walk, conversation, etc. They all have their own effect, like an EQ on mental noise! Fun to think about steering those vibes. Partial catalog (reply with more!):

        - https://t.co/lnd5Z3RnSO focuses on higher levels of reader investment, but it’s not difficult to imagine adjusting those mechanisms to make e.g. blog posts more impactful for a fixed level of reader interest.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684239899201537
        - In this sense, there’s something for everyone. A fixed level of reader investment can yield a bigger impact. A fixed level of desired impact can be had with lower investment. The minimum-viable-investment shifts downwards; the maximum-accessible-impact shifts upwards.

        - New cognitive media can bend these efficient frontiers up for _everyone_, establishing a new baseline. Helping a median reader access the impact curves of an 80th percentile reader. Helping a 99th percentile reader access new curves altogether. https://t.co/ihgYbSVgT8
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684237923704832
        - To some degree, these curves are all personal to each reader: if you learn great study skills and build great discipline, you may be able to bend the whole frontier of some medium upwards for yourself. So, yes, it’s great to teach people how to study, but:
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684237214928896
        - Different mediums have different frontiers. Film makes that clear: at low levels of “reader” investment, that format can consistently deliver so much higher levels of impact than books! But since they’re necessarily shorter than books, perhaps they’re harder to study deeply. https://t.co/IoN6d3yjep
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1140684235134517248
        - If we overlay the best works in a medium, we’ll see them approximate an “efficient frontier” (https://t.co/ESLQ4xcXLQ)—the limits of that medium's efficacy at a given level of investment. Good writing/editing is in part about trying to get closer to this frontier. https://t.co/NMGN7xQRzS

        - More academic texts might offer nothing below some level of reader investment yet handsomely reward a week of serious study. Accessibility stretches a text left; depth stretches a text right. More effective texts are shifted upwards, offering more impact at any level. https://t.co/42bGIsECsY

        - I framed the piece in terms of mass-market books to give everyone a common basis, but I see this as a continuum.

        - In https://t.co/PdABtZsEjY, I argued that non-fiction books are surprisingly ineffective for typical readers. One common (great!) criticism I heard was: Isn’t reader interest the biggest factor? So what if vaguely-interested people don’t absorb much from pop non-fiction? (Thread)

        - @danielchooper @peterhajas @kylemacomber I see! Yes, you can think of it as a sophisticated version of “when needed.” A typical immediate mode implementation would not have the same kind of tracking. It would need to e.g. compare all of this frame’s draw calls to all of last frame’s.

        - @danielchooper @peterhajas @kylemacomber In the case where most of the UI does not change each frame, as is the case in typical application UI, the overhead of diffing is generally lower than typical immediate mode overhead of repainting/emitting-draw-calls.

        - @SafiBahcall By focusing on "learning outcomes," approaches like intelligent tutoring systems tend to completely remove the human element.

I'm very sympathetic to that perspective. I don't treat it thoroughly enough in this essay (just one ¶ about pathos), but your argument's central to my critique of most edtech systems designers. Emotional connection is a high order bit.

                - **Full thread**

Struck by a market-making provocation from 
@tristanharris
 today: "Imagine a world where you love how you make choices and you love how you're directing your attention, because tech inventors are competing to figure out how best to help you live as you intend."

It's not clear how to align incentives so that this becomes a relevant design question for tech co's, but I'm enjoying the prompt. It's interesting that OSes have contacts, calendars, docs, etc—yet no representation of anything purposive, of ways of being, of "what matters?"

Funny to contrast the ubiquitous to-do app's model with intentions which might deeply matter to someone, like "I want to make sure I'm taking my ideas as seriously as possible." Tasks are such a misleading way of thinking about intention. But hey, it's easier to build a to-do UI!

        - @webdevMason @tristanharris I love this. To the point I raised in another tweet about meditation, I probably wouldn’t have started that if I understood what it really was for. There is an inferential distance problem here. But that framing sure seems awfully patronizing.

        - @webdevMason @tristanharris One more reflection: I think part of the trouble is talking about what "people" "want" in any durable sense. People change.

        - @karankurani @michael_nielsen That's very helpful, thank you. You mentioned "scroll up," which surprises me a little: the review sessions shouldn't involve any scrolling. Could you let us know what kind of device you were reviewing on?

        - @karankurani @michael_nielsen Thanks, that’s good to know. Can you say more about the mistapping? Was it that you weren’t trying to tap on anything—just adjusting your grip, say—yet a review was triggered? Or that you accidentally tapped ✅ when you meant ❎?

        - It's about beginning to go beyond our everyday classical intuition, and to develop tools and heuristics for thinking about the quantum world.
            - https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1118572463749599237
        - The essay isn't just about the search algorithm. It's also about learning to think in the quantum realm. Think of it as an introduction to quantum algorithm design, introducing many techniques which can be used in other algorithms as well.
            - https://twitter.com/michael_nielsen/status/1118572454627008512
        - This second essay begins to play out that notion.

Our first essay (https://t.co/ZiXVbbPs1K) introduced QC's basics. Many readers reviewed that essay's concepts 5+ times over the last few weeks; with that growing fluency, we hope they'll find quantum search more accessible.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1118572244827926528
        - When people struggle to learn complex ideas like quantum search, how often is that—perhaps even invisibly—because they're not fully fluent in the prerequisite concepts? They might "know" the prereqs, but only with so much cognitive load / delay that they can't absorb more.

        - @Conaw @davedelong Cool! Quick take: interesting ideas connecting annotation to synthesis. Doesn't appear to be trying to be a reference library, but that's fine.

        - @mattcassinelli @tolmasky Has a very specific flavor because of browned milk solids. Sometimes good, often not what I want. I'm mostly cooking New American food. In that context, clarified butter is useful, and ghee is a convenient pre-clarified butter. But I want clarified *brown* butter pretty rarely.

        - @jessiechar @tolmasky Don't get me wrong: I'm a heavy salt fiend! :)

But I'm always tasting and salting as I cook; I don't want to throw off my seasoning by e.g. mounting a sauce with a few T of butter at the very end.

When baking, I'm adding salt by weight, don't want to account for butter's salt.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1114201253553119232
        - @jtaby @tolmasky For eating raw, you mean? If you buy high-butterfat butter, it's soft even at fridge temp. For spreading on toast or something, I just spread it cold and then top with some crunchy finishing salt.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1114200607634546689
        - @tolmasky * Only unsalted (I control salt)
* Only ingredient is cream (no "natural flavoring")
* If I'm baking: ~82% butterfat
  - If sweet: sweet cream or mild cultures (Kerrygold, Challenge)
  - If savory: cultured (Président)
* If cooking/raw: 84+% butterfat, cultured (Straus, Vermont)

        - One common theme appeared to be that basically everyone was frustrated with their current solution! That's interesting.

Maybe it's hard to enter this market because everyone has very different conceptions of what they want from such a tool.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1113886673383772160
        - For me, the use case needs low-latency capture and meandering, which means local copies of everything and native performance.

No one mentioned DEVONthink, though it's a big player in this category. Unfortunately, its UI. Keep It is a nice new alternative, but fairly barebones.

        - Thank you for sharing, all! Reflections:

Many people suggested text-centric note-taking apps for this purpose. The interaction paradigm seems misaligned: I think of this need in terms of ubiquitous capture, seeing, connecting, searching, synthesizing, etc. Feels more like this. https://t.co/9PBIgVZBnq

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1113637636441165825
        - Twitter, do you have a system for your reference library—construed broadly to include web articles, images, games, videos, etc—not just papers?

Note-taking software feels ill-suited to the purpose; academic reference library apps too heavy for this; webapps are all too slow; etc

        - Prior to HQ Trivia, had there ever been a moment where two million people were simultaneously playing the same game?

Directly, I mean: sure, lots of people play MMOs at once; I mean the same game context—same turn, same state. As if the same round of a huge shared board game.

        - @rob_rix @dan_abramov @sophiebits @sebmarkbage I think you could solve the reordering problem using flow-parser’s AST output actually (in the common case that lval bindings for calls to hooks stay constant).

DS is robust to those intermediate states by speculatively evaluating each key press and unwinding if needed. So good.

        - @dan_abramov @sophiebits @sebmarkbage Regarding order/type changes: what if the tool embedded a flow server? Would be enough for types but not order. For that you’d want an incremental AST diff—paging @rob_rix

        - @dan_abramov @sophiebits @sebmarkbage Right: the ability to swap the function body out but keep the same hook state struck me as promising in the spirit of DisplayScript’s state cells. Here’s hoping!

        - @sophiebits @dan_abramov @sebmarkbage Curious: has anyone yet used Hooks to build a state-preserving live editing tool? Reloads are so awful—I'm still hoping for DisplayScript's glorious ability to update the running program on every editor keypress without losing state. :)

        - I think lots of fields could use some "translational medicine"!

As for my own work: I believe there are many powerful ideas in cognitive science desperately waiting for the same seeing-together insights, bench-to-bedside feedback loops, and concern for everyday practice. 5/5
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1111031873361178624
        - I love that the field recognizes two distinct barriers: 1) translating basic science into possible drugs, diagnoses, etc; 2) translating clinical research into everyday practice. These are very different problems, and both must be solved to benefit patients. 4/5 https://t.co/R4PBzZ2aBd
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1111031871347941376
        - Translation suggests unidirectionality. Indeed, the field used to frame itself as "bench-to-bedside," suggesting that the bench produces ideas which the bedside consumes. But they later abandoned that framing, realizing it's a loop: contact with application informs the bench. 3/5 https://t.co/zhaeHYEnwV
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1111031865677217794
        - One key insight: this translation is *foundationally* interdisciplinary. With increasing specialization, it's often true that neither the relevant scientists nor the relevant clinicians/bioengineers can see a path to application on their own. They can only see together. 2/5
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1111031865144569857
        - Have you heard of the field of translational medicine? I've found it a tremendously helpful analogy for my own work.

The field focuses specifically on trying to turn basic science discoveries into possible paths for clinical application. This is a useful idea in many fields! 1/5

        - @sophiebits Yes, we thought a lot about that. In brief, probably both are helpful. Making cards is itself a skill; that skill is hard to acquire and is metacognitively taxing; like all such skills it is best to scaffold it. Very interested in designing a “next step” on this scaffold.

        - @garybernhardt This is much like your Loader superclass solution, but I find I can usually abstract away more boilerplate with a higher-order component.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108845858991177728
        - @garybernhardt One approach I have used is to make a single prop as you described, but without the undefined alternative; make a higher-order wrapper, generic over prop type, which renders a loading UI if prop is undefined, or argument component if prop is present.

        - @MitchShanklin @vgr I worried about this when I started using spaced repetition. At least for me, after many thousands of cards, I appear to be nowhere near an upper bound. I add more cards; they get memorized; the curve doesn't change. I suspect we underrate our memory capacity.

        - @metasdl @michael_nielsen ITSes are certainly a major influence on all media of this kind. A more serious positioning of this work relative to prior systems will have to wait for a longer form context, but in the meantime, try this for a few days and let us know if it feels like a typical ITS.

        - Then, the next day, you'll get your invitation to your first review session. A few minutes of study, repeated over about 20 sessions over the next year, and you'll remember everything forever. It feels like cheating. One reader: "The bang for the buck is extraordinary." https://t.co/j2JbYkcmM1
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108069000938872833
        - That's the retrospective effect. The *prospective* effect is a feeling of safety. Once you’ve read a few sections, now you read each new passage knowing that you’ll have this quick check at the end. It's a save point every few minutes. You're not going to miss anything.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108069000318054400
        - One reader said: "There was a section where I tanked them all. I thought: wow, I clearly didn’t get whatever I was supposed to get. […] So then I went back and asked ‘why am I not retaining this?’ I’ve never had that with a textbook before: usually the problems are at the end."
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108068999730876416
        - Something felt totally mysterious? You just learned that you left the stove on before you left the driveway. It doesn’t feel so onerous to read a section again on the spot. It would feel much more tiresome to realize that a few days later… so you might not reread the section.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108068998879404032
        - Imagine you’ve just finished a tough section. We say: catch your breath; let’s take stock. We quickly flick through what we learned. Got it all? Great, we’ll review again later, when you've probably forgotten. Something slipped your mind? OK: we’ll review that bit sooner.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108068998233489408
        - One reason books are hard is: readers run all the feedback loops. "Did I really get that? Should I flip back?" This demands attention to both the content and also the meta.

We interleave prose and lightweight spaced repetition to take some of that work off the reader's plate. https://t.co/vy7ewONxYh
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1108068997042298880
        - Happily, there's a way to remember anything almost effortlessly: spaced repetition. A few minutes each day—as much memory as you want. Magic.

But few people use it. Textbooks don't leverage it. Tools for it desperately lack design. What if we fix it up and build it into a book? https://t.co/808j9XjCsI

        - What's the total "inefficiency" in human potential represented by this optimism gap?

What is the maximum return to increasing optimism—even if only to match people's own professed held and values? What about to the level which reflects reality?

        - On a few occasions, I've had the opportunity to help others notice this. It's a startling experience: people react a bit like they were caught talking in their sleep. Others have done this for me a few times, and I'm so grateful.

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1089223735750549504
        - I'm not even prescribing a normative "people should be more optimistic" (though I think that too). What's so striking is that people often undershoot optimism/ambition relative to *their own* held beliefs about what is possible and valuable. They're just using cached thoughts.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1089223735175860224
        - Sure, this specific advice is not appropriate for everyone, but I love the genre of optimism-generating media. Everyone has some optimism/ambition "efficient frontier" (relative to risk tolerance, values, etc); many behave nowhere close. A simple nudge can remind what's possible. https://t.co/3aCnYHObts

        - @lululucywow @ESYudkowsky My research has focused on K-12, rather than higher ed, so I learned much from it. My favorite thing about Minerva is that it takes its own ideas very seriously and plays out their implications. This is rare in institutional education.

        - @FPallopides @ESYudkowsky They graduate their first undergraduate class in a few months. Some initial assessments show promising growth (included in the book), but of course it's all very preliminary, and I feel selection bias in admissions could still explain the measures published thus far.

        - @cicatriz You're right: I oversimplified. Lots of relevant "new theories." For me, the key idea is recognizing that the default path for our media operate on known-ineffective theory. The important thing is to *ask the question*—to actually have an operative theory. Which theory? Depends.

        - @dela3499 Yes, those are valuable preconditions for learning in any medium, but it's just not the case that they reliably work great, even in that setting.

        - @KeeganLarson @michael_nielsen I don’t think the rendering modality is the high order bit. To believe that, I’d need a persuasive theory of why 2D dynamic platforms can‘t produce the media we desire, and I havent heard one.

        - But what's the equivalent of a "book" which was composed using an effective theory of how its reader will learn? We don't know.

It's a rock and a hard place: we know the old theory's wrong; we don't know how to make media which operate under our new theories.

Exciting times.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1081382568446947328
        - Books (and videos and lectures) sometimes work anyway, but because the learner's doing the heavy lifting—making connections, posing &amp; answering questions, etc

In apprenticeships and great classrooms, the new theory (constructivism) operates: teachers foster active assimilation.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1081382567864000514
        - Knowledge media face an awkward chasm between theories.

The old theory was naive transmissionism: "I'll convey this knowledge by telling you about it." That's effectively books' learning model.

But we know that model's wrong: learning is an active process of assimilation.

        - @cwhitney Right! Industrial manufacturers already do this (except for the sweetness bit—they're way too sweet), but the chocolate will be awful. You can make ice cream at home to use really good chocolate, but you need these techniques to match the texture and flavor release of industrial.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075641898218319875
        - @MaxTagher No, but because I'm making my own base I can adjust fat, egg, and sugar content appropriately for each flavor, and I can use the heating process to infuse ingredients like coffee. Premade bases are hard to infuse well (can't reheat too hot), and they have fixed component ratios.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075640910384267265
        - @MaxTagher One funny reason why homemade can easily be much better than ice cream shops' is that in many states (like CA), if you mass-produce ice cream, you must start from a base made w/ an inspected pasteurization facility. So they all use the same bases from e.g. Strauss and doctor it.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075627590709170176
        - @MaxTagher It's much better than what I can buy from an ice cream shop, but not as good as ice cream from serious pastry lines at high-end restaurants. Relative to typical ice cream, mine's:
- way less sweet
- higher fat
- better flavorings: I'll use $$ ingredients; a $10 retail pint can't

        - I love making ice cream at home, but this series really leveled me up: https://t.co/NY70m9lZhY

Three ideas:
1. Dextrose + invert sugar to lower sweetness
2. Milk solids to depress the freezing point and lower water %
3. Replace most eggs w/ gums to stabilize w/ cleaner flavor

        - Once one's attention is on the writing-a-card cost, environment becomes a key barrier. The cost is way higher on a smartphone keyboard, so I make cards on my laptop. But my habits often misalign: I read while out, I read in bed, etc—the laptop's not around. Gotta "buffer" cards…
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075487477803081728
        - I think there are ways to mitigate that cost, but some of it's essential: in writing cards, I'm synthesizing, comparing, filtering, personalizing, etc. I'm interested in structures and routines which support me in doing those things more rapidly or with less friction.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075487477211648001
        - This leads to a *very* unintuitive feeling: it's… effectively free to memorize as many new cards as I can write? What?

Which in turn means that for me, the real marginal cost is in the moment of *writing* a new card.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075487476674834432
        - For instance, often I'll review cards while waiting 10 minutes for the next train. This doesn't "cost" me 10m because I would've just been screwing around on Twitter or something. And even with 1000s of cards, it often takes less than 10m! I can't write new ones quickly enough!
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075487476095963136
        - In spaced repetition, it's tempting to ponder per-card cost—"should I pay three minutes over my lifetime to memorize this?"

But for me, marginal cards are effectively *free* to add:
1. I review cards in time that'd be dead anyway.
2. I can't add enough cards to fill that time.

        - @nayafia Nice post; thank you! I also struggle with explore/exploit tradeoffs… but something about the tension I feel in these statements isn't captured by that dichotomy. For instance: sometimes when I need to explore, "butt in chair" really does help!
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1075203726275530753
        - I've found truth in both these aphorisms:
1. Creative insight is more about noticing and cultivating expansive mental states than it is about #hustleporn. Take a walk.
2. Screw that: butt. in. chair. "Stop not writing," per @annelamott

Twitter, how do you approach this conflict?

        - @redblobgames I will say this: if you observe people closely enough, there are magicians everywhere. The answer to the question: "Would I have done that?" is so often "No, it would never have occurred to me." And, very often, that means there is something to be learned.

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1072944262860292096
        - In that sense this kind of report shares many goals with academic research publications—particularly design-based research (e.g. https://t.co/bR1GFxSa7i), but with a practitioner's cultural values and priorities: more qualitative, more pragmatic, more willing to speculate.

        - By documenting the chain of reasoning from past work to user research to design attributes, and by describing all the approaches they tried instead of just the final design, others can build on not just the interface design but the thinking behind it. https://t.co/rQNy5SCYA3

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1065434952282619904

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1060943797855576064
        - Interestingly, Apple's interconnected chain of ideas typically took the form of storytelling. Those stories encapsulated complex beliefs, intuition, and reasoning. The key insights were often not something A/B-able: the territory was revealed by "look at this prototype."
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1060943797159219200
        - Metrics and A/B-ing are sometimes useful tools for evaluating pieces of the chain of ideas. I was wrong: when companies mindlessly A/B, the issue is not that this tool is useless; the issue is often that they don't really *have* an interconnected chain of ideas.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1060943796542693376
        - Different tools help us survey different parts of the territory and validate different parts of the chain of ideas that represents the map. We choose tools according to our confidence in each link and according to their cost, sensitivity, specificity, field of view, etc.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1060943795850596352
        - What matters is the interconnected chain of ideas that leads from [observed need, market state, org capacity, insights about reality, values] to [design decisions, trade-offs, strategic bets].

That map needs to match territory.

        - @hamish_todd @dsemenov @3blue1brown @ben_eater @minutephysics @khanacademy This is very interesting! Thank for sharing. My instinct is that there’s value in always being *able* to interact, even if most people exclusively do so during narrative pauses—means you don’t have to track state before acting on an impulse.

        - @dsemenov @3blue1brown @ben_eater @hamish_todd Yes! It’s great. I almost listed it. I think it’s not quite the same medium, though, because this experience is mostly not interactive throughout. Still worth listing for comparison, especially since Hamish does some more game-like “turns” of control.

        - @kocienda Yes, but possibly only if it’s a skill the child has decided they want to acquire. At this point, better for me to direct you to the relevant passage.

        - @stevedekorte No, the claim is weaker than that. E.g. for students who have grown up in households/communities with minimal attention or conversation (and who therefore possess language deficits), direct instruction remediated those deficits more reliably and rapidly than other methods.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1054797850754908161
        - @kocienda No, Kay argues that we should choose goals which emphasize leaps of beauty and insight over, say, proficiency with a set of standard skills. So: is it possible that student-directed methods support the former but are judged by the latter?
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1054796942490779649

        - It actually feels kind of like a weird conservation-law violation? No matter how many cards I write, it seems I can soak them up by spending ten minutes or less per day. I assume that at some point I'll hit a limit, but it's way, way higher than I thought it was!

        - When I started using spaced repetition, I felt weird internal pressure not to make too many flashcards. That was wrong-headed: empirically, I easily absorb cards faster than I can reasonably create them (myself), and it feels way better to just create tons indiscriminately.

        - @devonzuegel Ooh: I've never considered this seriously either! Wonder how to measure it, but—is there a mindset difference for you? e.g. for handwriting:
* slow input means it's a "calmer" vibe, yielding "slow thought"—sometimes good?
* I often spontaneously interleave mental maps + diagrams

        - @kamens @rsnous @danluu I see it as a neat convergence of top-down and bottom-up: top-down, the mandate was "60fps or death"; mid-level, the mandate was "code like embedded engineers; we'll be tracking who's slow!"; the 1-2 devs who did touch decided "that means no malloc" (among other things).

        - @rsnous @danluu Another story came to mind you might find interesting—also probably applicable to these realtime ML systems: as of a few years ago, in some spots, iOS actually *predicts* where your touch will be one frame in the future based on past motion to squeeze out one frame of latency.

        - @rsnous @danluu 100%! I was part of a project trying to cut one frame of latency out of iOS's touch response. Cutting just a few ms down required changes top-to-bottom in the OS!

Alt story: iOS touch code had a fun rule—zero dynamic allocations allowed between touch HW event and app code!

Relates too, to the history of personal computers: at the Lincoln Lab during WW2, Licklider (a psychologist) was brought in as an outsider to help engineers predict enemy pilot psychology.

        - @mayli Depends on exactly the context you're trying to use 'em. But, say, the max-brightness ones vs white text? Probably not. I was surprised to see that these wide gamut screens also add a lot of new rich blacks. Here's the part of the color wheel only available wide-gamut at l=9/255: https://t.co/RlEoTV6PkK

        - @wittkensis Yeah, that's one way to think about it. Neon lights emit closer to pure spectrals; these wide gamut displays better approximate that. More on the theory here: https://t.co/o1pUiTnqFZ

        - Given the present trend toward ultra-saturated colors, I'm surprised more folks haven't tried designing "wide gamut first," with fallback variant designs for traditional sRGB displays. Feels like the early Retina days, except with way slower adoption.

        - I bought a serrano chili today. It cost 6c. They're so hot that one's all I'd ever buy. For gross revenue to equal 1 hr of minimum wage, the store would have to sell 250. 50/50 they sell that many in a week. Made me wonder: why do stores stock them? Why do farmers grow them?

        - Two weird visual metaphors for Twitter that resonate with me:
1. People+ideas are Brownian-motioning about; Twitter turns up the temperature and adds ephemeral gradients.
2. Twitter creates intermittent "wormholes" on social network graphs, making occasional "long hops" possible.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/1001870024125001729
        - It's fun to imagine looking backwards in 2050 at the progress that's been made since now. How many powerful ideas became thinkable through the fluid connective tissue and collaborations Twitter (and successors, maybe) made possible? Easy to imagine answering "lots."

        - @JensAyton @ereid I think I could have done that in Pages, too—converted to Page Layout mode after I had a solid draft—but that's still segregating by mode of production, you know? Once we had scissors and tape on the table, we realized that the text and images are so intertwined…
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/999714961600360448
        - @ereid :) I'm not sure what the answer is here. I guess the broadest observation is that there's a steep cliff between word processor mode and page layout mode. Fascinating design challenge to turn that into a smooth gradient.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/999667786359062528
        - Funny that even though I've got the Tufte-isms so deeply ingrained in me, I still started with tools segregating by mode of production—because they're the default. I wish it were easier to do otherwise: using Pages like this still had way more friction than making a normal doc.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/999664282500349952
        - That way, we centered on imagery where it made sense and left images in a side column where it didn't. And we could cut quotes into the layout differently according to their emphasis in the narrative.

Realtime multiuser collab in Pages was great! Should have started there! 2018!
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/999664281774796802
        - 3. Awkward: slide docs are best for image-first documents, but our prose should actually be primary (well, except for two spots where it shouldn't be…)
4. Print it all out, cut it up—tape, sharpies, post-it-notes
5. Full-manual, magazine-style layout in Pages. Done in 3 hours.👌

1. Team's been working on a detailed narrative of its work (default: let's collaborate in Google Docs)
2. Oh, but… there's all these important visuals and juicy quotes (try a slide doc?)

        - @sophiebits Outlines can communicate structure and the broad presence or absence of big ideas but don’t have enough meat to portray much about framing, emphasis, explanation. I suspect this makes discussing e.g. areas of skepticism harder: the points are too abstract.

        - I don’t think “high tax welfare states” alone explain it: many things are &gt;50% more expensive than in SF, but VAT and income tax differences wouldn’t explain that. And average rent is less than half SF’s. (c.f. https://t.co/dfjsDxKiMx)

        - Test: "How many buses does the army need to transport 1,128 soldiers if each bus holds 36 soldiers?"
Many students: "31 remainder 12."

Is it fair to say that these students really understand division?

        - @michael_nielsen Best analogue I see is in the foods industry, in which many people have a solid sense of what kinds of foods are "good for them," seek them out, pay extra for them, sometimes even track their benefits, etc. But there's still McDonalds, too.

        - @JoelChan86 I hadn't; thank you. This resonates, but per Postman, I'm feeling like I'm way over-indexed on news—irrespective of commentary-vs-reportage and digital-vs-tactile—and have benefited from a substantial shift to books. Maybe especially because I was already too news-heavy.

        - One lens I've used to pick focuses is something like a likelihood ratio: expected value with one's involvement over expected value with one's likely replacement.

I somehow only now realized this factor strongly favors situations where one's in an outsider/contrarian position.

        - @mschoening @mayli @farrarscott @cgingold @JanPaul123 This connects to one of the core Dynamicland ideas—if you can't see it, neither can the computer. It's about breaking down the wall between creator and consumer; the code is the object is the code. The markers are a distracting temporary solution to implementation practicalities.

        - @Ben_Reinhardt @lpolovets @mayli Not sure that would be good. Though homeschooling has benefits in some circumstances, my very shallow understanding is that many of those benefits seem to accrue from the same types of forces that make tutors 2-sigma better than 30:1 classes, plus strong selection bias pressures.

5. … and indeed, that's exactly what we're doing.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/958597412595159040
        - 1. All universities *say* they want to… (e.g. help students attain a global perspective)

        - @b0rk We’ve mostly approached it from the intellectual honesty/self-awareness angle: we deal with stuff we don’t know constantly, and so we can’t afford to value *appearing* to have all the answers. It has to be safe to not know, followed by discovering together.

        - Reminds me of old "tip of the day" UIs, but much less self-important. When I use Headspace, I'm actively trying to build a skill, so I'm very interested in new ideas to bring to my practice; when I use e.g. Eclipse, I'm trying to accomplish a task, and the tips are in my way.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/943519534677336064
        - The ideas are subtle, so one per day is an appropriate rate. And they're integrated into the medium and context of practice, fuzzing the boundaries between (their) idea and (my) practice. Imagine a big "tips!" article with all this content: I'd read it once and forget most of it!

        - Headspace has some lovely invisible instructional design. I've used it for years, so I don't need/want prompts anymore during meditation—what's the point? Each unguided day has a 30–60s pre/postamble with a small new idea to consider. Not part of the explicit value prop; no UI.

        - Does a similar thing happen in groups in creative work? Are individuals' "zone of proximal creative possibilities" expanded? In the same way, through the same means? Dubious! Certainly, sometimes synchronous group collaborations lead to that zone *contracting*…
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/941389924820926464
        - One connection is to Vygotsky's social learning theory, which features similar "up and to the right" charts to Mihaly. Vygotsky suggests that social interaction can expand a learner's "zone of proximal development" (i.e. the sweet spot) through even indirect communication.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/941389923948494848
        - There are commonly-understood strategies for achieving Mihaly-style flow individually… but how does flow behave when synchronously collaborating with a group? Is it psychologically the same? Are the prerequisites the same? I think not! (great lunchtime question from @nsbarr)

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/937496154157105152
        - e.g. video's great to demonstrate the delicate dance of managing the reducing liquid in a pan of glazed vegetables, but text seems better for quickly absorbing recipe's components, ingredients, steps (particularly once one has context). I wish we could more fluidly combine them…

        - @jeffpotterusa Right! It’s 400°F dry bulb for the PID, I assume… I wonder if that means it’s actually heating atmos. vapor to close to 400°.

        - @andy_matuschak this is how you use an abstraction in a project: using it in an explanation that would be clunkier w/o it. imho

        - @arvidgerstmann Right. It’s abstract, but I think their work roughly is a project using the concept, testing its boundaries &amp; consequences.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/770629231361470464

What about abstract ideas like ontology?

        - @martinkonicek @notbrent No, all sides. React/JS people will only get so far without understanding the platform. All abstractions are leaky.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/705801440548114433
        - @notbrent I think it’s a lot more compelling if you’re not trying to incrementally adopt, and you don’t have a sizable team already spun up.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/705509840781602816
        - @notbrent that said, there are tons of positives to r-n, and i’m very excited about its trajectory

        - @notbrent
– unknown perf implications
– weak gesture solution
– JS feels like a step backwards
– requires learning yet more things
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/705508303741124608
        - @notbrent
– we’ve already hired a bunch of platform experts
– platform changes might violate r-n’s assumptions or cause extra churn
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/705507899565412352
        - @notbrent but here’s more:
– incremental adoption impedance
– debugging across native/JS boundaries
– lack of existing expertise
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/705507689611161600

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/704102987820433413
        - I’ve misused talks as a medium many times—maybe more often than not? Many would be way more effective as articles or literate code.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/704102013097738240
        - I suspect we may overemphasize talks (even when it’s the wrong medium) because it’s a way to actually make people “publish.” Works on me.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/704101970953445376
        - Too often we treat talks as “the” medium for conferences without considering the medium’s properties. How can we incorporate other mediums?
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/704101942214025216
        - Talks are not a neutral medium: they’re good for sharing some kinds of information (rhetoric, story) and bad for others (facts, details).

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702275566259449856
        - @ccheever It's not so bad to disassemble UIScrollView and extract the relevant methods…
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702275470520295424
        - @alper yes
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702203900426760192
        - @wooster sure is. but hey if you don't have UIKit as a dependency...
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702201974213578752
        - @wooster next step will be to ditch UIKit and just own the rendering stack

am I kidding? not sure
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702200292138332160
        - @optshiftk difference is typical framework vs library stuff. DO tries to hide things; r-n gives you tools for building abstractions
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702200120729702400
        - @wooster yeah that is always a risk but at least you have source. I've now repeatedly disassembled UIKit to figure out its buggy behavior…
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702199660253831168
        - @optshiftk ah interesting. relay does reduce siloing between server and client people
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702199128932003840
        - @steve_holt yes and yes. but high level goal is to make it possible for an individual to be DRI for a product or feature on all platforms
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702198431746424832
        - @steve_holt broadly: its architecture decouples app structure from the UI framework; same team can more readily ship on all platforms
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702196701159776256
        - @JPMcGlone Primarily in favor of the philosophy and approach; implementation still growing. But broadly: yeah.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702195669654642688
        - @optshiftk ? I don’t really follow. Is this trying to be sass?

Silo reduction comes from enabling the same devs to build for all platforms
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/702194903627857920
    - 
        - Most exciting thing about React Native to me is the impact on organizations. Reduce siloing, increase collaboration, unify release cycles…

        - @mrgan they could *build* it, though it would be annoying (reverse engineering). they can't *sign* it themselves, so phone won't run it
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/699983231802683392
        - @timcamber @mrgan enclave has extremely limited communications channel, so tiny attack surface
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/699982393873051649
        - @mrgan they can update the system software, but the user data on the phone is encrypted with a key the phone does not have.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/699982174187950080
        - @mrgan yes, if you're apple (ie. have their crypto keys). sometimes people finds a hole in this (jailbreak). none publicly known in enclave.

        - @mrgan it's possible that the timing rules are implemented in a way which cannot be updated (white paper doesn't say), but unlikely
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/699979667583799296
        - @mrgan on 6-and-up the enclave enforces timing, but its software can be updated too if you can prove you’re apple (that’s what the key does)

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/694309009826820097
        - @buzz @sandofsky Yep, there are various tactical concerns including serious perf overhead, async unpredictability, etc. Those are fixable.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/694308807694897152
        - @sandofsky It is very possible to use the observer pattern in a tree-like fashion, e.g. if the observed object is a subtree’s “root.”
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/694308087604183040

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/694307932670787584
        - @sandofsky The observer pattern, used without care, encourages more un-tree-like control-flow / data-flow graphs.

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/693847643793936384
        - @salutis But: it’s useful to be able to refer to actions by name (“my child’s requesting ’the increment’ action? delay that until xyz…”)
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/693839450145554433
        - @salutis Well… you didn’t, really. You just moved them around. Your actions are reducers now. They’re implicitly State -&gt; State.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/693839144158531585
        - @salutis No, I think that’s actually the right role. I suspect you’re onto something if you’re using an instance of UIVC, not a subclass.

        - @JPMcGlone So, if Sounds have reference semantic instead of value semantic, then perhaps their lifetime can be tied to removeSound…
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/683409040949432320
        - @JPMcGlone Other alternative is to pass around instances of a Sound type:
struct Sound {
  init(named: String)
}

Dunno if it’s worth it.
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/683407908982226944
        - @JPMcGlone i.e. maybe one component wants to prepare all sounds on launch, and another wants to play them—should they both ref by filename?
            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/683407011241836544
        - @JPMcGlone I wonder, too, whether it makes sense to dissociate filenames from sound identities.

            - https://twitter.com/andy_matuschak/status/683323367894585344
        - @JPMcGlone Nice! One thought: it’s dangerous to have methods like removeSound on a singleton—how can any client know it’s safe to call that?
