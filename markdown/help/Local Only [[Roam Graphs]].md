- We shipped this feature for [[Roam Believers]] on [[June 9th, 2020]]
- How it works
    [[MVP]]
        - Currently, Local Only graphs are stored only in Local Storage on your browser
            - This means that if you clear all the data in your browser -- all of these local only notes will be lost - unless you have exported a backup
                - see "[[Import]] and [[Export]] for local graphs are the same as with [[Hosted [[Roam Graphs]]]] "
        - You still need to be connected to the internet so that you can fetch the Roam site - but none of your notes are sent to our servers.
            Also see "How to verify your data isn't sent to our servers"
        - [[Import]] and [[Export]] for local graphs are the same as with [[Hosted [[Roam Graphs]]]] 
            - You can export your data as [[JSON]] or [[Markdown]], 
            - You can import up to 10 Markdown files at a time
        - [[Restrictions]]
            - Currently you can not upload images or pdfs to Local graphs - to do so would require connecting to our servers - which sort of defeats the purpose...
    [[Goals]] for upcoming version
        - [[Desktop App]] - where you don't need internet connection at all to use Roam
            - Automatic synchronization with a directory in your file system - for JSON
            - 1 Way syncronization with Markdown files
                - Meaning - Edits to a Roam page will overwrite a Markdown file in your directory
                    - Which will allow you to keep a version controlled history of your Roam DB in git
                        - Changing those files will not automatically change the state of your roam though. 
            - [[MVP]] of 2 way syncronization
                - Ability to upload a Markdown file to your Roam and have it overwrite the existing contents of your roam db
- How to use
    - For [[Roam Believers]] if you go to your [[All Graphs]] page - at [https://www.roamresearch.com/#/app](https://www.roamresearch.com/#/app), and scroll down a bit - you will see a list of all Local Graphs saved to your browser (this will be a different list for different web browsers), and a button to create a new one.

- How to verify your data isn't sent to our servers
    - On Chrome you can see all network communications by pressing F12 and then opening the `Network` tab
    - [[Hosted [[Roam Graphs]]]] will send data via WebSockets, and you can see the list of sent messages by filtering for `WS`, and clicking the individual WebSocket connection
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fhelp%2F18CVnHE2wY.png?alt=media&token=e1035db0-564d-42b6-9366-2d1466b7f6ed)
    - [[Local Only [[Roam Graphs]]]] won't have the WebSocket that sends messages with your data, but will still have the WebSocket that sends message about logging in, user data, and permissions
