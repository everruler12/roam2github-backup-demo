- Demo of Roam
    - Questions::
        - What are the types of things I'll want to do in Roam?
            - Take some notes
            - Doesn't matter where
                - To create a new page you can click the + button
                    -  we don't like that though -  as those pages are now disconnected
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2FyTjlflMTFv?alt=media&token=b5e98794-cf13-400f-a022-9e96d1a062d0)
                - Better to start in the daily notes, and often to take the notes there, just nested underneath the topic you're writing about, which might be a page
                    - So
                        - [[Bio Class]]
                            - Teacher said this
            - When you don't know where to put it, just put it on the thing for the day
            - When you have an idea, that you think you'll want to refer back to... like this guy was talking about 
                -  "the little recs or ideas or facts you learn from someone in conversation,  could now be **saved and compounded and connected** so you can come with **better ideas going forward.. ** 

if it delivers will **unlock more productive ingenuity and ideas than basically anything else since Google, wikipedia, 3g....** I'm probably hyperbolizing, but it really doesn't feel like it is.

            - Then you sometimes are going to want to make a page for that idea 
        - How do I make a word into a page?
            - You write it inside `[[`Inside this thing `]]`  
            - you can also highlight a word, and then hit `[[`
            - if you forget this, you can also hit the / command, and choose `link` 
        - How do you make things have a special font?
        - So, let's say I make a database of quotes and stuff in Roam, how do I use it for actually writing and formatting a paper
            - Probably want to look at [[Writing Tips in Roam]]
        - So let's say I'm ready to right a paper about epidemiology of malaria and I'm ready to start writing a doc, how do I move things around without pulling them out of their context
            - [[Block Mentions]]
            - Example
                - [[Cognition]]
                - [[My paper on Cognition]]
                - 
    - Note:: The best part of the demo, was creating a new page with a common word, and showing how it pulled in a lot of quotes and then we could find something interesting
