Todos are the backbone of [task management]([[Task Management]]). We have been using them in our bullet journals, task apps, and now... Roam.
Creating todos in Roam is incredibly easy! Below are different ways to do that:
    - **Right clicking on the bullet**
        1. `Right-click` on the bullet you want to transform into a todo.
        2. Click on `Make TODO`
    - **Using the keyboard shortcut**
        1. While you're editing the block you want to transform into a todo, hold:
            - `cmd-enter` (Mac)
            - `ctrl-enter` (Windows)
    - **Using the / Autocomplete Menu**
        1. Type `/`
        2. Hit `enter`
