- Logging is first and foremost about getting to a foundation for [Doing Science!]([[DO SCIENCE]]) on our attention.
    - "Doing science on attention." 
        - The most important thing is cadence. 
        - How many times per day did you shift attention? 
        - Notice environmental impacts on flow, interruptions, distractions. You might be able to optimize. 
- The important value here is to get ACCURATE picture of [[Attention Allocation]] for yourself and **eventually** to be able to identify counterproductive things about our workflow where we can get [[Increasing Leverage]] on our time.
- **So what exactly do we have to log?**
    - Start Time - End Time 
        - Activity 
        - Note: End of your attention to the task! If you get #sniped by #emails, new timestamp.
