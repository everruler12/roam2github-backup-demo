To create a page shortcut, within the page you want to create a shortcut to, click the star button located in the top right next to the search bar.
Clicking this star button will add a shortcut to that page in the left sidebar menu, making the page one click away from wherever you are in Roam.
If later you want to remove this shortcut, follow the same process. Enter the page you want to remove from your shortcuts, and then simply un click the same star button.
Here's an example:

Other ways you can navigate to any page in Roam is to use the search bar on the top right. Click on the search bar (or press command + u) type in the name of the page you want to go to, and press enter.
And finally, perhaps the most Roam way is to do so is in the flow of your writing- type the name of the page you want to navigate to in square brackets [[Example page]] in any page which makes a link to that page on the page you are currently on, and then click on this to navigate to the page.
That's shortcuts. Feel free to [[try for yourself]], and [[keep on Roaming!]]
