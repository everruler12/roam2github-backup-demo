                            - "Rules for Roam"
                - What is the difference between a block and a page?
                    - A page is a global idea 
                        - Person, place, thing, abstract concept, repeated category/tag idea, phrase
                    - A block is a specific node - on a page, in a hierarcy on that page
                        - can be built of references to other pages and blocks
                    - attributes
                        - "Blocks and Pages in Roam can both have attributes" 
            - Takeaways::
                - followup questions::
                    - How to show off my Roam usage in a way that is not a demo / press release
                        - A bit harder since have not been doing as much synthesis work on writing / research recently
                        - Big area that will be be good is in product management type work
                            - Starting to organize feature requests into our Roadmap / getting a sense for how the pieces are going to be fit together
                - The todos that I have placed in this Roam haven't really been ones I've been going through and executing on -- in 2020 do want to go through these and clean them up a bit
