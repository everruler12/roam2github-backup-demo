    - Working on csv import, for purpose of importing in a few thousand tweets into Roam
        - Goals::
            - I want to grab all of the tweets from [[Tiago Forte]]
            - have the plain text of all of them
                - What happens if I just paste the csv
                    - The most important paragraph I've ever read on modern education. I'm stunned

            - I think we could also get around this a little bit by having a tweet-embed toggle, so that you could choose whether or not to show the tweet

    - Simplest CSV import is just going to create a nested list
        - Name
            - Tweet text
                - tweet url
    - Next version of it would let you define attributes
        - Tweet text
            - author:: x
            - url:: y

        - "In a recent chat with @michael_nielsen and me about https://t.co/lnd5Z3zN1g, @delong suggested that the mnemonic medium is a new kind of catechism. We laughed, butâ€¦ that's a pretty interesting lens! (thread) https://t.co/A6szlDLzri"
            - similar to ideas I've heard from [[diviacaroline]]
