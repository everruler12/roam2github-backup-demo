    - **Name:** [Trailmeme](https://www.trailmeme.com/)
    - **Quick Pitch:** Trailmeme is a new kind of web publishing that allows users to create, annotate and walk individually curated trails through web content.
    - **Genius Idea:** Trailmeme, a Xerox-incubated startup that celebrated its official launch at [DEMO](http://www.mashable.com/tag/DEMO) this week, is a tool that enables users to bookmark and then organize web content into diagrams to draw connections between them.
    - Imagine, for instance, that you wanted to illustrate the [history of the battery](http://www.trailmeme.com/trails/The_Battery_Industry) (see below), or [Foursquare](https://mashable.com/category/foursquare/)'s rapid ascent in terms of popularity. For Foursquare, you could build a cluster, or diagram, showing how a [single profile](https://mashable.com/2009/03/16/foursquare/) of the startup led to [one major brand partnership](https://mashable.com/2009/10/22/bart-and-foursquare/), which led to additional coverage by a couple of blogs, which led to a [proliferation of other brand partnerships](https://mashable.com/2010/02/08/foursquare-media-deals/), more media coverage, a [Forrester study](https://mashable.com/2010/07/27/foursquare-marketing-study/) and news that the social gaming service had surpassed the [3 million user mark](https://mashable.com/2010/08/29/foursquare-3-million-users/). The story you could tell with this kind of diagram would be much more comprehensive than a chronological list of links to articles about Foursquare milestones; it could also help you draw connections about who tends to provide early coverage in the space, what news sources marketers read and how technology and/or marketing trends gather momentum on the web.
    - The tool isn't limited to just linking articles and illustrating trends, however — see this [Periodic Table Trail](http://trailmeme.com/trails/The_Periodic_Table_Trail), for example, which takes advantage of the app's ability to add tags and commentary to each box on the diagram.
    - Trailmeme is still in an early stage of development (the startup is still "twist[ing] and turn[ing] in search of a business model," founder Venkatesh Rao tells us), but the team behind it has created both a web-based app and [Wordpress plugin](http://www.trailmeme.com/tools/WordPress) that enable users to create and explore these kinds of diagrams, as well as a [Firefox toolbar](http://www.trailmeme.com/tools/firefox_toolbar) and [bookmarklet](http://www.trailmeme.com/tools/bookmarklet) to tag content you eventually want to diagram.
    - Soon, the startup hopes to branch out into enterprise knowledge management. Rao explains that employees spend a lot of time hunting down information on poorly-organized intranets. "If trails can make even a small dent in that wasted time, the productivity gains will be huge," he imagines. "And if organizing information becomes a fun and creative visual activity instead of a bureaucratic burden, the problem of knowledge management will simply go away," he says.
    - Trailmeme's ultimate mission is to help denizens of the web overcome information overload or, as Rao likes to call it, information anxiety. "The real-time web is great, but it has us constantly living at the microsecond level, tweeting furiously on our smartphones," he says. "We don’t dare step back, because we are afraid we’ll miss something. The way to overcome that fear is to have the big-picture tools that allow you to step back and look at the web at different scales, see things in context and not always be clicking the squeakiest tweeted link. A trail can reveal that the most important article on a topic is a year-old blog post rather than the latest, squeakiest link."
    - Rao's dream is to one day see "a bunch of people at an airport, on iPad-like devices, zooming in and out of the web using trails and really making full use of the power of their brains to process information at multiple levels and through multiple modes: visual, verbal, tactile," he said.
    - "And I’d like to see them doing so with relaxed control and mastery instead of the anxiety and stress I see on people’s faces everywhere. I’d like to see us literally getting on top of information instead of being buried by it. If Trailmeme can help do that, there’s no telling where we could go."
