A common question we get asked at Roam is how to share your private graph for others to view or edit. This tutorial will show you how to do it in three easy steps:
**Step 1: Click on the **... **menu in the top right corner of the window**

If your graph is set to **Public**, anyone with the URL can access it.
If your graph is set to **Private**, readers and editors must have a Roam account to access the graph.

Once you typed out the designated emails and pressed **enter**, you will see a list of emails added tothe bottom of the list. This indicates that your graph database is now shared with those people.
