- Whenever I have a meeting, I tend to create a bullet point on my daily note file with a structure like this
    - 17:52 -- 18:30  (38 minutes)
        - [[Meeting]] with [[Tiago Forte]] and [[William Eden]]
            - Note -- this is a fake meeting
            - Discussion about [[Time Management]]
                - Will thinks best book is [[Eat That Frog]]
                - Tiago is a fan of [[GTD]]
        -  `I track how much time I'm spending on things roughly by using "current time" `
