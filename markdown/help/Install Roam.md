- ### **Does Roam have a mobile app? Can I install it on my machine?**
    - Not yet, however Roam is available now as a webapp which gives you full access to your Roam and functions in a similar way to an app available through the appstore.
    - Here's how to install Roam as a webapp on your **phone** or **tablet**:
        - Go to chrome (or the other browser you use such as safari, firefox etc), then go to [http://www.roamresearch.com](http://www.roamresearch.com/), and it will ask you to sign in to your Roam account.
        - Once you sign in you will see this screen below. And then click the prompt at the bottom that says 'Add Roam to homescreen', which will install Roam as a link on your tablet/phone.

        - An alternative way to do this, if you go to [roamresearch.com](http://roamresearch.com/) and sign in, you should should see 'install full site' as a button on the top right of page, if you click this it will install Roam on your device.
