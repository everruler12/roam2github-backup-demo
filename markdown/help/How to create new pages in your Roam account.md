## Create pages by typing square brackets [[ ]]
    - When you type two opening square brackets, [[, anywhere in your existing Roam pages, Roam will automatically complete with the closing square brackets. Then to create a page: all you have to do to is write the title of the page within those brackets. Hit enter and the title will turn blue indicating it has now become its own page!
    - Here's an example, where I created a new page called 'Swimming' to log my swimming sessions. Without leaving the Daily Notes, I created the [[swimming]] page, which I can then move into and back from (bidirectional linking!). I then also created a TODO for myself to look up more info for the local pool.

    - Creating new pages by typing square brackets in the flow of your writing takes some getting used to, but it is one of the distinctive features of Roam. Compared to other note-taking software which relies on the traditional sequence: __file -> new->  dropdown __or __file tree menu systems__, with Roam you'll expend no energy on file management. Pages - and insights! - will come about seamlessly, in the flow.
    - If you have text that you have already written, it's also possible to highlight a word or phrase, and with it highlighted  pressing [[ ]] will also turn it into a page.  Here's an example:

## Create new pages via the search bar on the top right
    - You can use the search bar in the top right of Roam to search your existing pages, and you can also use it to create new pages.  Click on the search bar (or hit cmd+u) and your existing pages will start showing up as you type.  If you want to create a new page, type the title here, press enter, and the new page will be created.
    - Here, I use the search bar to create a page for cycling.

    - In terms of end result, there is no difference between the pages created with either method - [[swimming]] or [[Cycling]] both will be new pages in your database. However, the first method creates pages in the flow of writing, more spontaneously, while the second is used more consciously to create a page that you may have in mind.
    - These are the ways to create pages in Roam, feel free to [[try for yourself]] and [[keep on Roaming!]]
