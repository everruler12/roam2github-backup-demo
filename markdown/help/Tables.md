- This is definitely an #Experimental Feature
- We'll be building out a more powerful set of features around databases soon
- For now, Tables are really just a different way of viewing an indented list
    - So, when you are listing out a bunch of similar items and defining similar properties, this lets you view that bulleted list as a table
        - Example
            - {{table}}
                - **Entity**
                    - **Attribute A**
                        - **Attribute B**
                - 1
                    - 1A
                        - 1B
                - 2
                    - 2A
                        - 2B
                - 3
                    - 3A
                        - 3B
        - You can use all the other features of Roam in here as well
            - {{table}}
                - **Claim**
                    - **Certainty**
                        - **Significance**
                - All Men Are Mortal
                    - {{a}}
                        - {{a}}
                - Socrates is a Man
                    - {{a}}
                        - {{a}}
                - Socrates is Mortal
                    - {{a}}
                        - {{a}}
                - If "All Men Are Mortal" and "Socrates is a Man" then "Socrates is Mortal"
                    - {{a}}
                        - {{a}}
- If you have strong opinions about this feature -- or about integrating database type attributes into your Roam account in general, we'd love to hear from you
