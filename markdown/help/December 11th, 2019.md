        - "I'm sorry to say guys, but the entire domain of [[Memex]] stuff incl. Bush, [[Engelbart]], etc. is of no use in ^^**popularizing** the practice of organizing knowledge^^. It hasn't worked for the last 60 years and never will, because it doesn't map to anything in people's daily lives"
        - ## The point here is sort of is that he is right that they don't help him with **his** goal of selling courses on how to use tools that don't actually work for people, because the ideas they were talking about aren't well reflected at all in the tools
            - but the whole idea of ^^popularizing the practice of organizing knowledge^^ is totally a fools errand with the tools we have today
                - the reason it doesn't map to anything in people's lives is because the mainstream tools don't map to the way our minds work, and don't map the the ideas that [[Vannevar Bush]] or [[Doug Engelbart]] were talking about
        - Evidence that [[Doug Engelbart]] was further ahead than anyone else

        - "I‚Äôve doing a full Digital Jubilee at the end of the year:

All books/articles not finished will be archived
All tasks not completed will be archived 
All incomplete projects archived

I‚Äôm starting completely over on Dec. 31. I don‚Äôt want next year defined by this year‚Äôs inertia"
        - In order for his other notes to get out of the way, he has to archive all his shit
        - That's the problem with not just having easy collection

    - [[vgr]][[Knowledge Management]][[Collective Intelligence]]
        - "Knowledge generally depreciates, and a holy grail of knowledge modeling and capture for a long time has been to reverse the default negative interest rate it accrues and turn it positive. There was a ‚Äú[[knowledge banking]]‚Äù project at Xerox back in the day that aimed at this for eg.

"
        - "By contrast in weaker media, I have to be in high energy, direct focus headspace, having warmed up around 30 minutes to get situation awareness around the whole project. Only then can I reliably lower entropy and turn interest rate positive. Roam lowers threshold to 10% of that.
"
        - "This btw is the maker time/manager time problem pg wrote about. Making needs 4 hour chunks because anything less tends to increase entropy rather than decrease it in any non-trivial knowledge work project. So anything that lowers that lower limit is a big win. #[[Maker Schedule]]"
        - "My suspicion is, a good KPI for a knowledge tool is minimum threshold of time required to make a negentropic update to it, with every halving of the threshold increasing its capacity to hold positive-interest-rate knowledge repos by an order of magnitude.
Venkatesh Rao
@vgr
"
        - "So a tool with a 2h minimum can sustain a 10x bigger positive-rate knowledge base with the same budget of people/money than a 4h minimum. I suspect for Roam, a very suitable project may get it down to minutes, and for a typical project, maybe 30min.

Something like that.
