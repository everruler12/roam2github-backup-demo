        - ## The point here is sort of is that he is right that they don't help him with **his** goal of selling courses on how to use tools that don't actually work for people, because the ideas they were talking about aren't well reflected at all in the tools
            - but the whole idea of ^^popularizing the practice of organizing knowledge^^ is totally a fools errand with the tools we have today
                - the reason it doesn't map to anything in people's lives is because the mainstream tools don't map to the way our minds work, and don't map the the ideas that [[Vannevar Bush]] or [[Doug Engelbart]] were talking about

        - In order for his other notes to get out of the way, he has to archive all his shit
        - That's the problem with not just having easy collection

            - There are people who spend their whole career now studying Luhmann, but he had no research team, no assistants, and famously said

"I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else"

This is what we want!

Stress free productivity!

            - ### [[Claim]] Of Course it Isn't useful for popularizing the ^^practice^^-- the whole point of their work was in pointing out the ways our current systems fall short -- you can't use them to sell your online course using tools that they spent their careers pointing out flaws in
                - "Our present ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of indexing.  When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is) by being traced down from subclass to subclass."
        - [[Main Point]] "one has to have rules as to which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome" [[Vannevar Bush]]

        - "Knowledge generally depreciates, and a holy grail of knowledge modeling and capture for a long time has been to reverse the default negative interest rate it accrues and turn it positive. There was a “[[knowledge banking]]” project at Xerox back in the day that aimed at this for eg.

"
        - "By contrast in weaker media, I have to be in high energy, direct focus headspace, having warmed up around 30 minutes to get situation awareness around the whole project. Only then can I reliably lower entropy and turn interest rate positive. Roam lowers threshold to 10% of that.
"
        - "This btw is the maker time/manager time problem pg wrote about. Making needs 4 hour chunks because anything less tends to increase entropy rather than decrease it in any non-trivial knowledge work project. So anything that lowers that lower limit is a big win. #[[Maker Schedule]]"
        - "My suspicion is, a good KPI for a knowledge tool is minimum threshold of time required to make a negentropic update to it, with every halving of the threshold increasing its capacity to hold positive-interest-rate knowledge repos by an order of magnitude.
Venkatesh Rao
@vgr
"
        - "So a tool with a 2h minimum can sustain a 10x bigger positive-rate knowledge base with the same budget of people/money than a 4h minimum. I suspect for Roam, a very suitable project may get it down to minutes, and for a typical project, maybe 30min.

Something like that.
