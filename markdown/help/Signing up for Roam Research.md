You will then be taken to the membership page. To use Roam you need a current membership.
We have a three different membership levels. Monthly ($15), Yearly ($165) and our 5 year Believer plan ($500).
We offer a free 31 day trial on monthly and yearly membership levels, which means that you can trial Roam for a month without any charge.
However these memberships do require you to enter your credit card details in order to start your free trial. We don't charge you at all during the 31 day trial, and you are welcome to cancel without charge (instructions at bottom of page).
Select the plan you would like and then press start free trial.
