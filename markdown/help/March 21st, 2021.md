        - By "augmenting human intellect" 
            - we mean 
                - increasing the capability 
                    - of a man 
                        - to approach a complex problem situation, 
                    - to gain  in:
                        - comprehension
                            -  to suit his particular needs, 
                            - and to derive solutions to problems. 
                    - Increased capability in this respect
                    -  is taken to mean a mixture of the following: 
                        - #.rm-g
                            - more-rapid comprehension, 
                            - better comprehension, 
                            - the possibility of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously was too complex, 
                            - speedier solutions, 
                            - better solutions, 
                            - and the possibility of finding solutions to problems that before seemed insoluble.

                    - We do not speak of

    - Augmenting man's intellect, 
        - in the sense defined above, 
        - would warrant full pursuit by an enlightened society
            -  if there could be shown a reasonable approach and some plausible benefits.**[1a2](https://www.dougengelbart.org/content/view/138/#1a2)**
    - This report covers the first phase of a program aimed at developing means to augment the human intellect. 
    - These "means" can include many things
        - —all of which appear to be but extensions of 
        - means 
            - #.rm-g #.rm-d —-
                - #.rm-g —-
                    - developed 
                    - try
                    - used 
                - in the past
                    - gg 
        -  to help man
            -  apply his 
                - native sensory, 
                - mental, and motor capabilities—
        - and we consider the whole system of a human and his augmentation means as a proper field of search for practical possibilities. It is a very important system to our society, and like most systems its performance can best be improved by considering the whole as a set of interacting components rather than by considering the components in isolation.
