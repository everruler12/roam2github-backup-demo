    - **DONE**
    - ### Roam for [[Gratitude journal]]ing
        - Practicing gratitude is one of the few positive psychology interventions that's proven to make us happier.
        - Only problem is: hardly anyone actually does it.
        - This is some juicy low-hanging fruit, and Roam makes it easier to pluck.
        - You can add a #gratitude tag to a note whenever you feel thankful, or include a section in your Daily Notes that prompts you to pull out a few highlights from the day:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FAAUSdozFqk?alt=media&token=ffe4cde7-f8df-4881-a404-a8764895d3b4)
        - Besides feeling good in the moment, you're also building a central repository of warm fuzzies that you can draw upon whenever you need a boost.
        - Best of all, you can use filters to [[DO SCIENCE]]: find out which people and activities add the most joy to your life, and in which contexts - then be sure to tell them:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2F5YPQd-ws3y?alt=media&token=15724e99-4f68-4469-b765-8e90b762d460)
        - Thanks for using Roam. We're grateful to have you on board ðŸ˜‰
        - __Tip: if you're not sure how to add tags or use filters, check out our help page here.__
    - ### Roam for [[Conflict resolution]]
        - Half the problem in resolving conflict is figuring out the crux of the actual disagreement.
        - One way to explore this is to make a note of any personal or professional conflicts in your daily log, tag the topic and context, and any steps you intend to take.
        - Then you can [[DO SCIENCE]] by looking through your log for recurring patterns:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FLh9F62Y28K?alt=media&token=6854ca89-3d90-4d65-a31f-5c8f937eb6b9)
        - Which might generate some insights:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FdRoAFJt5CZ?alt=media&token=5ae4612c-ef77-4409-9fe8-31f60746be3d)
        - You can also prompt yourself with suggestions based on previous lessons learned:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FtrcfpZa4fe?alt=media&token=9bc211df-577c-4b0e-83d3-1ca3f3ae6285)
        - __Tip: if you're not sure how to use filters, check out our help guide here.__
    - ### Roam for [[GTD]]
        - [[Roam for GTD]]
        - Has already been done, and is too in-depth for our purposes here - better to do something like 'Roam for time management', and link to the GTD guide from there.
    - ### Roam for [[Reading list]]
        - So many books, so little time!
        - There is no solution to the bibliophile's dilemma, but here's how Roam can ease the burden.
        - Whenever someone gives you a reading recommendation, create a new page for it, and add some metadata:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2F5-RwBB_3K6?alt=media&token=717d1034-8be1-485a-b098-239ec8afb072)
        - Now when you visit your [[Books]] page, you can filter your list on any of these attributes.
        - For example, you might only want to see all the #science or #design books recommended by a trusted curator, while screening out those you've already read:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FjIC8uq6hkk?alt=media&token=44141e8b-e076-405f-8367-df22739aa539)
        - __Tip: We've used soft linebreaks (Shift + Enter) so we can see all the metadata at a glance, but you could also nest the data in bullets under a__ #Books __or__ 
#[[Reading list]]__ tag.__
        - And of course, each page you reference will also point back to the books and texts associated with them.
        - Some inspiration for other potential connections:
            - Bottlenecks or precursors to reading this book
            - Harder reading material this text 'unlocks'
            - Current or future projects this might be useful for
            - A slider for weighting importance, and updating on new info
        - One of life's great tragedies is that there are far more interesting books and papers than we can possibly hope to read in the candle-flicker of a single lifetime.
        - But at least we can do a lot better than the usual scattershot approach!
    - **TODO**
    - ### Roam for [[Time Management]]
        - Trying to keep track of a bunch of open loops and to-dos can be overwhelming.
        - Roam makes it easy to get them out of your head, and organised into atomic tasks.
        - You can jot down tasks and stray thoughts in relevant project pages, or dump then in your Daily Notes.
        - Once they're broken down into concrete actions, you can use tags like #urgent or #[[this week]] to sort and prioritize them.
        - You can also use the Datepicker tool to assign a reminder or a deadline, which generates a backlink on the relevant day:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FzW_410boDP?alt=media&token=7bd174a9-cf94-4b02-af01-5a8caff103a4)
        - __Tip: You can convert multiple blocks into to-dos at once. Select them all, and then right-click on the highlighted area.__
        - You can use the Current Time feature to timestamp each activity through the course of a day, and get a better sense of you're spending your time:
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Frich%2FdyUGO5ObJP?alt=media&token=65e9ffd9-b2fb-4ef9-95bd-b220ee150e8d)
        - __Tip: The Date Picker and Current Time stamp are in the slash command menu for rapid access.__

    - ### Roam for book notes
        - X was unusually good but I feel like I need to process it more. I'm going to import my Kindle highlights and break them down into subcategories.
        - Huh, this claim clashes with what X said. How to reconcile? Time to [[DO SCIENCE]]!
        - OK, now I've updated, I'll add a slider to express my confidence: {{[[slider]]}}
        - That reminds me a lot of this concept from Y. I'm going to add a reference here.
        - Example gifs:
            - I've added plenty of book notes so can pull out some that fit the format above.
    - ### Roam for logging workouts
        - Time to get shredded. Let's see, what did I train last time? I'll take a look at my training log...
        - Alright, I want to do dips on the rings, and L-sits from parallettes. I can filter my log to see my previous personal bests for each of those variants.
        - Now I'm gonna make a new training log entry in my daily notes, and plug in my sets, reps and volume.
        - I'm also gonna take note of the fact that my knee is still feeling a bit dodgy, and create a todo to make a physio appointment.
        - Example gifs:
            - I do this already so can easily record an example, e.g. quick screencap:
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2F80QLJFsLr1?alt=media&token=a0c8e163-ea88-49d4-82d7-aae06969244b)
    - ### Roam for [[Morning Pages]]
        - __Meta: it might be better if you do this one since I've never actually done this before and not super familiar with how it works.__
        - __Here's a variant I could do, not exactly morning pages but more of a riff on time management.__
        - OK, wake up in the morning. First thing I want to do is empty my monkey brain, I notice I feel a little anxious so gonna do some freeform journaling, link to any concept or person that comes up.
        - Cool, now I have more clarity. I'm going to check my todos, the reminders in my mentions of this log day, and make a list of tasks to accomplish.
        - Alright, I'm set! Gonna use the Current Time picker to do some time-tracking of each task too.
        - Example gifs:
            - I can use some real examples from my database.
    - ### Roam for self-experimentation
        - __Meta: I think__ [[Quantified Self]] __has huge potential but it is a bit underpowered in Roam until we get automated addition/averaging and graphs working. I'm struggling to think of an example that isn't too reliant on manual number-crunching, will have another go tomorrow.__
        - I want to try a few different melatonin dosages and then track my sleep quality over time.
        - First I'm gonna design the experiment on the melatonin page, and pin it to the sidebar.
        - Now it's time to [[DO SCIENCE]]!
        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2Fw-mz1n4yBW?alt=media&token=b0f85825-a3fd-46af-8dac-c20cfcbb0ee4)
        - __Meta: are these janky tables gonna get axed at some point? If so I guess it might not be a good idea to use them in a demo (although can always link to whatever replaces them).__
            - Probably best to replace this with [[Attributes in Roam]]
    - ### Roam for [[Relationship Management]]
        - __Meta: is there a special name for a system like this? I can't remember what it's called. As someone with a terrible memory I honestly feel like this is a minor superpower: yeah, course I remember the names of your kids!__
        - OK, I see I've got a call with Sonnie today. First thing I'm gonna do is visit his page and revisit the precis of what we talked about on the last couple calls.
        - Oh yeah, he was going to submit his grant proposal last month - let's make a note to follow up on that. I also need to give him an update on the situation with the group house.
        - After the call: OK, that was fire - I'm going to upload the whole Otter transcript and tag it with the relevant topic areas.
        - Also gonna make a couple todos for the book he recommended and a potential contact he said I should reach out to.
        - Example gifs:
            - Have to stage this a bit so as to not actually share personal info but happy to do so from my database.
    - ### Roam for [[Zettelkasten]]
        - Is too in-depth for our purposes here - better to do something like 'Roam for book notes', and link to the Zettelkasten guide from there.
    - ### Roam for collaborative research
        - __Meta: getting tired and tapping out here, will resume tomorrow__
