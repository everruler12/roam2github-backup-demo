Awesome! Thanks for signing up to Roam.
The first page you will see is the graph overview page.  A graph is another name for a database. Inside a graph is where you will do all the work in Roam, writing, making blocks and pages.  And to get there, you have to create your first graph.
**Create your first Graph**
Click the + Create Graph button show below.

You will then be prompted to choose a graph name in the pop up.
Just a warning! It's currently not possible to change your graph name after it has been created. Renaming graphs will be a feature in the future, but for now, please name your Graph something you will be happy with for a while.  If you are unsure, something generic related to your name is a safe strategy.

Once you have entered a New Graph Name and pressed Create Graph you will be taken to the daily notes page within your graph.  Congrats you are now officially able to use Roam!
The help menu will automatically launch when you first enter Roam, with Conor's video series on the different features of Roam.  This is a nice place to start.
