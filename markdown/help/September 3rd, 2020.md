            - If you would like to also copy-references for the blocks which are nested below the block you are dragging, hold shift-key before dropping the block to do this.
                - Note:: This action (copying all nested blocks) was previous default behavior - but we found that frequently it was not what we actually wanted.
                    - The new feature makes it much much easier to now create a table of contents.
