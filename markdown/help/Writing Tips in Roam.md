Hey Writer,
    - Here are a few things you might find helpful
        1. [[Document Mode]]
            - If you want your writing to look more like a page than a bulleted list you can right click the page title and select view as document
            - :imghttps://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2FScreenshot%202019-08-13%2020.09.23.png?alt=media&token=c4cc9324-1c97-4029-bf1f-b6d0a1f93002
        2. Creating headers
            - You can create headers with key commands or by right clicking on a bullet point
                - with key command
                    - If you hit `command-alt-1`you can get a header
                        - # This is a header
                    - if you hit `command-alt-2` you get a subheader
                        - ## This is a subheader
                    - if you hit `command-alt-3` you get a sub-sub-header
                        - ### this is subsubheader
                - With right click
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fv8%2Fhelp%2Fi9xi_o4WJa?alt=media&token=0e87c87c-ef5a-4dd5-9b02-54d3d49d9e15)
                    - That is also where you can change the alignment of a piece of text if you want to center something
        3. When there is a whole subsection I may want to change, but not throw out the draft I use `command ,` to create version control on a block
        4. storing quotes
            - I like to create a page for [[Quotes]]
                - When I'm reading an article, or exported my highlights I paste things under a heading for quotes so it shows up in the mentions, and tag them with the relevant topic
            - When I'm writing, I'll often just put the quotes in via a `block mention` like such
                - "A knowledge base allows you to reuse past work, draw from past experiences, share your knowledge in concrete form, and eventually, build products and services out of that knowledge."
        5. Version control on words
            - if I'm searching for the right {{or: term | phrase | word}}, and I don't want to break flow while drafting, I'll use an or block like such to show the options I'm considering for the word
`{or: term a | term b | term c}`
        6. Version control on subsections
            - Option 1
        7. I like to use {{word-count}} along with a [[Morning Pages]] habit, of trying to write 750 words per day
            - Word count will count all the words in a block and all the words nested underneath
For a person trying to use roam for writing, here are some handy todos to get you started #[[Example]]
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Learn to use version control in Roam
        - hit `command ,` to version control this block
        - click the number button to show tabs for your different versions
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Make an {{or: word selection | or block | word choice}} in Roam
    - {{[[TODO]]}} Keep track of words with `word-count` {{word-count}} 
    - {{[[TODO]]}} use the Mentions feature to collect some thoughts on a topic
        - {{[[TODO]]}} paste some of your existing writing in -- and use "the unlinked references to see if you've written about the same idea in many of your old notes
            - {{[[TODO]]}}  make some of those references explicit using tags
            - {{[[TODO]]}} make some of those references explicit using links
            - Note on "{{[[TODO]]}}  make some of those references explicit using tags" and "{{[[TODO]]}} make some of those references explicit using links" -- tags and links work the same way, tags are just for single word pages, and are a little less visually obtrusive
    - {{[[TODO]]}} use block-references to embed the same paragraph in multiple documents -- useful for quotes
