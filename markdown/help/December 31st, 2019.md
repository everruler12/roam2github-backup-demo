    - Great writeup on [[Reddit]] on [[Building a Second Brain]] in [[Roam]]
        - https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/eho7de/building_a_second_brain_in_roamand_why_you_might/
        - Writeup was missing [[Datepicker]] [[Features]] though, so created [[Roam Demo Videos]] gif and uploaded

                - using datepicker [[January 1st, 2020]]
                    - This is a great way to schedule due dates, or the next day you want to look at something
                        - since it will appear in the mentions of the next day
                        - [[January 3rd, 2020]]
