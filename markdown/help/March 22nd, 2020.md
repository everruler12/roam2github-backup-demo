    - Live stream of this is here https://youtu.be/ZLSPKigWNZo
    - "23:47 -- 00:06" only took 20 minutes to get setup
    - If it is simple to stream, and it can get saved directly to youtube - which we'll test right now - then this is totally worth it, as it could dramatically increase the number of tutorial videos we could be making.

        - Looks like the video got there right away

    - Two places I can think to start seeding this into a properly organized [[Zettelkasten]]
        - First is to start to pull in some of the notes from [[Andy Matuschak]]
            - but with that - need to figure out how I want to differentiate his notes from my own
            - [[Matt Brockwell: A Taxonomy of Notes]]

            - Found the link in "[[Matt Brockwell: A Taxonomy of Notes]]"

            - The prototype is much more readable - but it is interesting that it feels much less of a space for these scattered half developed thoughts
                - Even his least developed stubs are worthy of presentation - whereas these are much more obviously public scratchings
            - I'm feeling highly skeptical of the ida of just importing them wholesale
                - Seems more apt to put them in under at least a heading of the author

        - I totally now want an easy way to do the following
            - The title of the page should possibly be able to respect whatever namespacing convention we have set up
                - I like the idea of naming the title of the page - when importing a content - based on the domain that it has come in from
                    - Though - when we have the idea that nodes (today called pages) - can have more than just a string attached to them
    - 02:37 - 02:40
        - Playing around with naming convention for [[[[*]] Note Writing as Fundamental Unit of Knowledge Work]]
            - I could imagine doing something like writing writing out a proper Zettlekasten this way
                - Writing it without adding pages yet
                    - 1. [[The way you format your note titles in Roam matters]]
                        - [[1a Renaming a note in Roam should be done so that it appears in different autocomplete]]
                    - [[3 Changing the name of a note in Roam doesn't matter all that much]]

        - I definitely like the idea of numbering my permanent notes now - as it will make it easier to reference them associatively 
            - Trade-Offs:: 
                - Benefits:: You could Mark a note by its number even if you don't have a great title for it yet #[[Z/1/Questions matter more than answers]]
                - Weaknesses:: If you try to choose the right name for a few notes at the same time - or you are going back and forth on them - like I am with [[The way you format your note titles in Roam matters]] - then you have to either - not have written anything yet
    - 03:01 -- 03:04
        - A path for eliciting more of my notes for a zettelkasten 
            - steps:: 
                - Look for [[Key Terms]]
                - look through everything in [[Questions]]
