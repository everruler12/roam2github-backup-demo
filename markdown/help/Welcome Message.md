- Hey There
    - Thanks for trying out Roam,
    - Roam works like pretty much any other writing or outlining tool you may have used, but it has a lot more power available to you if you know where to look, and some features we know you won't find anywhere else
        - Particularly for connecting and organizing your ideas across and within documents
    - To see what's really possible, be sure to poke around our [Guide](http://roamresearch.com/#/v8/help/page/1308)
        - you can also find all the keyboard shorts available if you click the ? on the bottom right of your screen
    - If you have any questions -- feel free to send me an email at cwhitesullivan@gmail.com
        - If you want, you can create a page for [[Roam Feedback]] and share that link with us too
            - -- feel free to delete that page if you don't want to do this too!
    - Our goal is to help people map out their thoughts to solve otherwise intractable problems and unanswerable questions -- we hope that whatever you're working on, Roam can help you to grasp it more clearly
    - Good luck and thanks again!
