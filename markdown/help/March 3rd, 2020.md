- [[User Interview]] with Mariana
    - A common problem
        - Mariana speaks Spanish, English and Italian and want to link words across those languages
            - If I'm writing in English I would say [[Productivity]]
            - If I'm writing in Spanish I would say [[Productividad]]
                - Mi [[Productividad]] esta semana fue mejor que la semana pasada.
        - A temporary workaround until we have full aliases is to create a query block for ```{query: {or: [[Productivity]] [[Productividad]]}}```
        - Another alternative is to use markdown links to wrap Roam's internal links, so that you just always point to the node/page you want
            - Mi [productividad]([[Productivity]]) esta semana fue mejor que la semana pasada.
    - Questions about Privacy
        - Roam's data is hosted by google, encrypted at rest, and encrypted over the wires
            - We follow industry best practices for encryption -- same as Evernote and Notion - but we make an additional guarantee in our [[Privacy Policy]] to not ever read your notes without your persmission (Did you know Evernote engineers can read your notes?)
                - afaik
            - If you want more thorough encryption you can use [[Encryption]]

    - Questions about what I use in Roam that other people don't
        - [[Block References]]
            - for building up arguments
            - for [[Time Tracking]]
            - for [[Repeating Tasks]] and [[Standard Operating Procedures]] aka [[SAPs]]
