        - [Eat That Frog](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576754227/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=effeforgeek-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=1576754227) by Brian Tracy is an excellent synthesis of much of the existing productivity literature to date, achieving about 80% of the total benefits from [[Time Management]].  My summary here attempts to condense the book into a few pages of critical insights, organized into four primary sections: organization, efficiency, identifying your strengths, and optimizing yourself.  Implementing even a small number of these techniques will result in greatly increased effectiveness.
        - DO NOT WAIT, the time will never be right
        - Seven Step Method
            - Decide exactly what you want
            - Write it down – thinking on paper is critical
            - Set a deadline on your goal
            - List the steps necessary for achievement
            - Organize the list into a plan (priority and sequence, visual layout)
            - Take action on your plan immediately
            - Do something every day to move closer to that goal
        - Reasons for procrastination (and their solutions)
            - vagueness/confusion around objectives and how and why to accomplish them (write down goals, list specific steps)
            - feeling of inadequacy, lack of confidence, inability in key area of [[task]] (identify and learn key skills)
            - attempting to begin [[task]] while fatigued (protect energy level with diet, exercise, regular breaks/vacations)
            - important [[task]]s seem large and formidable upon first approach (resolve to do single step or limited time period)
        - ## Organization
            - Always Work From a List
                - Four lists: master list (to capture all ideas), monthly, weekly, daily
                    - Make a list of every step needed to complete project, organize by priority and sequence
                    - Just go as far as you can see, and be confident will be able to see farther at that future point
                    - Make the next daily/weekly/monthly list at the end of the previous day/week/month
                    - Transfer items from Master -> Monthly -> Weekly -> Daily
                    - When a new [[task]] comes up, add to list before doing it
                    - Tick off items as you complete them
            - ABCDE Method
                - Place letter next to each item
                    - #A : [[task]] you must complete, very important, major positive/negative consequences (rank many A items with A-1, etc.)
                    - #B : [[task]] you should complete, mild consequences
                    - #C : [[task]] is optional, would like to do but no consequences attached
                    - #D : [[task]] can be delegated, do so ASAP
                    - #E : [[task]] can be eliminated without any real difference
                - Never do a #B [[task]] when an #A [[task]] is left incomplete
            - Begin Immediately and Persist Until the [[task]] is Complete
                - Once you know the highest-value [[task]], everything else is a relative waste of time
                - Take action on the most important [[task]] first thing every morning
                - Once you start, keep working to full completion ([[task]] switching costs are a major time sink)
                - Notice if you are becoming distracted by conversation or low-value activity
                - Most identifiable sign of high-performing people is action-orientation, they are in a hurry to complete key [[task]]s
                - Urgency will generate action instead of discussion: focusing on specific steps, concentrating on results
            - Tricks to Get Started
                - It is easier to commit to doing a small piece of work, and momentum often keeps us working beyond the initial steps
                    - See also [[Intermediate Deliverables]]
                - Divide large/complex projects into distinct smaller steps, and resolve to do one of them
                    - See also [[Intermediate Packets]]
                - Resolve to work for a specific short time period, as little as 5-10 minutes (even shorter works too)
                    - See also [[Pomodoro Technique]] and [[Resolve Cycles]]
            - Create Deadlines
                - Imagine you have to leave town tomorrow, what absolutely must be done before you go?
                - Set deadlines (and sub-deadlines as appropriate) for every [[task]] and activity
                    - [[Meta]]: This is the next big thing for us to work on with [[Roam]] -- especially [[Roam for GTD]]
                - Determine how many minutes/hours each [[task]] will require, add a 20% buffer, then make it into a game to beat your own estimates
                    - #Scheduling [[Time Tracking]] -- in [[Features]]
            - Create Blocks of Time
                - Set aside 30/60/90 minute blocks for important [[task]]s
                    - #Scheduling [[Time Tracking]] in [[Features]]
                - Getting up early and working for hours before going to work is a key productivity habit
                - Time planner on day/hour/minute level enables you to see and consolidate blocks of time
                    - #Scheduling [[Time Tracking]] in [[Features]]
                - Plan your day in advance and schedule fixed time periods for particular activities (e.g. sales calls 10-11 AM)
                - During these work times, turn off electronic communication, eliminate any distractions, work nonstop
                - Use transition periods (“gifts of time”) to complete small steps in larger [[task]]s
                - If you fly often, plane rides are a great unbroken block of time, plan your work for the entire duration
            - Review your goals and performance at the end of every day/week/month 
                - [[Features]]
        - ## Efficiency
            - Three Questions for Maximum Productivity
                - What are my highest value activities?  (Think to yourself, then ask others)
                - What can I and only I do that if done well will make a real difference?
                - What is the most valuable use of my time right now?
                - The more accurate your answers are to these questions, the easier it will be to set priorities and do the most valuable [[task]] (epistemic rationality!)
            - Apply 80/20 Rule to Everything
                - Law of Forced Efficiency: There is never enough time to do everything, but there is enough time to do the most important things
                - A handful of your [[task]]s are likely much more valuable than any of the others
                - You get your time and life under control only insofar as you discontinue low-value activities
                - If you want to add something new, you must complete or discontinue something old
                - Completing high-value [[task]]s is more satisfying
                - Continually review responsibilities to identify [[task]]s which can be delegated/eliminated without loss
            - The most powerful word is “no”
                - Say no to anything not a clear high-value use of time
                - Say it clearly so that there are no miscommunications
                - Say it regularly as part of your time-management strategy
                - Say it early and often!
            - Question to Ask: “If I were not doing this already, knowing what I know now, would I start doing it again today?”
            - Improve Rate-Limiting Steps
                - There is always a rate-limiting step in every [[task]]
                    - {{[[DONE]]}}  add [[Theory of Constraints]] post from [[Tiago Forte]]
                - Identify that choke point, and make a single-minded effort to weaken that constraint
                - 80% of the limiting factors exist internally within you or your organization
                - Take an honest look at self and company, accept responsibility for your life and look to yourself for both the cause and cure of the problem
                - Accurate identification of the limiting factor can bring about huge progress quickly, otherwise you solve the wrong problem (epistemic rationality!)
                - The key constraint may be small and not entirely obvious, make a list of every step in a process
                - Behind every rate-limiting step is another one, so target the next one and alleviate that as quickly as possible
            - Questions:
                - What is holding you back?
                - What sets the speed at which you achieve your goals?
                - What determines how fast you move from here to there?
                - What holds you back from doing the most important [[task]]s?
                - Why haven’t you already achieved your goal?
            - Workspace
                - Clear everything off your desk until only the [[task]] at hand is in front of you
                - Have everything you need to complete [[task]] in hand before you begin
                - Make your work area comfortable, attractive, and conducive to working long periods
                - Once you complete preparations, begin working immediately
                - Assume the body language of high-performance: sit up straight, sit forward away from back of chair
            - Electronic Communication
                - DO NOT check voicemail/e-mail first thing in the morning
                - Tech is your friend, there to increase speed/efficiency/accuracy of information transfer, but can be addictive
                - Just because someone sends you an e-mail does not mean you have an obligation to respond (if the e-mail is important enough, the sender will resend)
                - Delete 80% of e-mails unread immediately. Only 20% of those remaining are urgent, put the rest in a file to respond later
                - Create zones of silence in your life where no one or nothing can reach you
                - Maintain inner calm by pausing on a regular basis to listen to the silence
        - ## Identifying Your Strengths
            - What Are Your Unique Talents?
                - Do what you love to do, and do it well!
                    - What gets you the most compliments/praise?
                    - What affects the performance of other people the most?
                - Ask yourself these questions:
                    - What am I really good at?
                    - What do I enjoy the most about my work?
                    - What has been the most responsible for my success?
                    - If I could do any job at all, what would it be?
                    - If I won the lottery, what work would I choose to do?
            - Rule of Three
                - Three core [[task]]s provide most of your value, focus on optimizing those
                - In thirty seconds, write down your three most important goals in life right now
                    - Giving people longer rarely results in different answers
                    - In most cases people have a financial/career goal, a personal relationship goal, and a health/fitness goal.
                - Expand to three most important goals in:
                    - Business/career
                    - Family/relationship
                    - Financial
                    - Health
                    - Personal/professional development
                    - Social/community
                    - Biggest problems or concerns in life
            - Key Result Areas
                - Your work can usually be broken down into 5-7 key result areas (KRA), where you are completely responsible
                    - Make a list of important output responsibilities, [[task]]s which feed into others
                    - Determine key result areas and grade yourself on 1-10 scale
                    - Your performance is only as strong as your weakest KRA
                    - We tend to avoid jobs where we performed poorly in the past
                    - Refuse to rationalize/justify/defend weakness, instead identify clearly, and make a plan to improve
                - Big Seven in management: planning, organization, staffing, delegating, supervising, measuring, reporting
                - Big Seven in sales: prospecting, building rapport and trust, identifying needs, presenting persuasively, answering objections, closing the sale, getting resales and referrals
                - Question to Ask: “What one skill would have the greatest positive impact on my life?” (ask others as well) 
        - ## Optimize Self
            - Skill Acquisition
                - Identify the most important things you do, and make a plan to continually upgrade those skills
                - You can learn any skills necessary to be more productive/effective
            - Three Steps to Mastery:
                - Read in your field at least one hour/day
                - Take every course/seminar available on key skills
                - Listen to audio during downtime
            - 3 D’s of New Habit Formation
                - Decision to learn new habit
                - Discipline to practice
                - Determination to persist until habit is encoded
            - Optimizing Mood
                - To perform at your best, you need to be in a good mood!
                - Level of self-esteem is critically important for motivation and persistence
                - The way you interpret things determines how you feel
                - Resolve to become an optimist
            - Four Behaviors of Optimists:
                - Look for the good in every situation
                - Seek the valuable lesson in setback/difficulty
                - Look for the solution to every problem (vs. blame/complain)
                - Think and talk continually about your goals
            - The biggest enemies are fear of failure/rejection and accompanying doubts
                - The way to overcome fear is to do precisely that thing
                - Act as if you already had the courage and behave accordingly
            - State maxims to yourself on a regular schedule, to internalize positive beliefs
            - Visualize
                - Imagine being your future awesome self, self-image has a powerful effect on behavior
                - Visualize how the world would look with your goals completed
            - Generate Intrinsic Motivation
                - See yourself as role model for others
                - Set higher standards for yourself than others set for you
                - Make it into a game!
            - Energy Level is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT for Motivation
                - Utilize the specific time of the day when you are at your best for top-priority [[task]]s
                - Sometimes your best use of time is indeed to quit early and get a lot of sleep
                - Take one full day off every week: no work or electronic communication or anything taxing. Instead do activities which replenish you
                - Take regular vacations every year, both weekends and 1-2 week breaks
            - Big three for energy level:
                - Sleep
                - Diet
                - Exercise
            - Questions:
                - What am I doing physically that I should do more of?
                - What am I doing that I should do less of?
                - What am I not doing that I should start doing to maximize performance?
                - What am I doing that affects my health should I stop doing entirely?
            - Work/life balance is not optional
                - Time management is a means to an end: freeing up time to do the things you love
                - The more in-person time you spend with loved ones, the happier you will be
                - What matters is quality of time at work and quantity of time in rest of life
                - When you work, work – wasted work time comes out of personal life
            - You are shaping yourself into a new, superior human being.  Be an ascending spiral of personal effectiveness.
