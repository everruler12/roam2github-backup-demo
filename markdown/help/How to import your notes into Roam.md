One of our most frequently asked questions is how to import notes into Roam. We currently offer two ways, through JSON and through Markdown.
If you are interested in importing Roam notes, we suggest you import with JSON, which stores more metadata about Roam-specific content and will allow you to more seamlessly move notes from one graph to another. On the other hand, if you plan to import text files from any other source, we recommend Markdown.
Here's how you can import notes in Roam:
1. Press **Import Files**__ __inside the **... **share menu at the top-right of your screen:

2. Now choose your Markdown or JSON files from your file system and you will see them show inside the pop up, where you can see a preview, change file names, and choose which files you want to finish importing:
