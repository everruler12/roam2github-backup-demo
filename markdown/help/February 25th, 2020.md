                    - like for [[Use Cases]] or [[Workflows]] or [[Problems]] that we solve
                        - I would have a page listing those - and each problem, I would have a page for that problem
                            - then when I'm looking at tweets or landing page material or copy from the competiotors, or from our testimonials, or user feedback or whatever, I'd be categorizing according to those use cases or problems
                            - similarly for multiple drafts I have, or keeping consistent messaging across company communication
                                - use [[Block References]] for that
