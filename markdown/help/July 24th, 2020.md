        - Funny you should say that. I'm ALL OVER ROAM these days.

Partly because I'm obsessed with graphs.

Partly because it's the thing I have thought about building for years (a personal information manager as a connected graph)

Nice job, @RoamResearch. https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1280478834085842945…

    - [[@vgr]] Tentatively, I think this deserves hype it’s getting. If they solve intake, it will be a genuine paradigm shift. They’ve managed to actually do what we tried valiantly to do with trailmeme at xerox a decade ago.  I can spot all the things they’ve done right that we got wrong.

    - [[@kylemathews]] Roam focuses on making it really easy to add atoms of thought and then gradually compose those together into larger pieces. Most note taking apps force you to impose structure from the get go which adds a lot of friction to writing. I'm writing 10x more with Roam than Notion.

    - [[@ec_anderson]] Quite rare when a new tool has nonlinear ROI. @RoamResearch bequeaths superpowers in short order. Opens up previously impossible capabilities. 

At first you’ll say wtf is this .. after an hour tho, you’re like where u been all my life?

    - [[@dan_abramov]] Hey #roamcult, what should I know as I try it
    - [[@dan_abramov]] I want @RoamResearch, but for code. An IDE.
    - [[@HarryStebbings]] What @Conaw and team have built is exceptional! Their biggest fan behind @jmj here!
    -  [[@HarryStebbings]] Creating The World’s Knowledge Graph 

Hear @Conaw describe the vision for @RoamResearch mapping and aligning the world’s knowledge. 

@garrytan @m2jr @infoarbitrage you have backed some of the most compelling visions, which first meeting vision do you think to most often?
