- Roam has a basic calculator component
- Example
    - `{{calc: 1` `+ 1}}`= {{calc: 1 + 1}}
- The calculator can pull block-references
    - It just strips the text to find numbers and "equation symbols"
        - equation symbols
            - +
            - - 
            - / = division
            - * = multiplication
            - ** = raise to the power of
                - 10 ** 2 = {{calc: 10**2}}
    - Example -- change the value of "A: 1" or "B: 2" and you will see "{{calc: ((MSl_pGiSi)) + ((H9rb4ssZm))}}" update
        - A: 1
        - B: 2
        - {{calc: ((MSl_pGiSi)) + ((H9rb4ssZm))}}
- This can work recursively 
    - A * B * (A + B) = {{calc: ((MSl_pGiSi)) * ((H9rb4ssZm)) * ( ((zZot1wT81)) )}}
- It can be hard to see how the equation works when most of the thing referenced are blocks
    - You can use control-c control-p to get a preview of the block you're looking at
    - You can also use Control-Shift-O to open a bullet point reference under your cursor in the sidebar -- which is useful for opening up the sources of variables  used in your calculation
- Note
    - The calculator using the javascript math engine 
        - {{embed: ((1kEhvYrnP))}}
        - and currently numbers are rounded to nearest int on display
        - 2**3 = {{calc: 2**3}}
        - 1.2**8 = {{calc: 1.2**8}}
- Example::
    - [[Simple Financial Model]]
        - Customers:: 700
        - Weekly Customer Growth:: 1.15
        - Price per Customer:: 15
        - {{table}}
            - **Weeks from Now**
                - **Total Customers**
                    - **Monthly Recurring Revenue**
                        - **ARR**
            - 4
                - {{calc: ((13bkU2J4M)) * ((ar8KTTCQs))**((0tI85foPL)) }}
                    - ${{calc: ((SX868MI-C)) * ((PCBUGgc7d))}}
                        - ${{calc: ((HqMKtcha9)) *12}}
            - 12
                - {{calc: ((13bkU2J4M)) * ((ar8KTTCQs))**((GPgFWnXTt))}}
                    - ${{calc: ((rd70VP-Ry))  * ((PCBUGgc7d))}}
                        - ${{calc: ((MZ1mCzpml)) * 12 }}
