Sometimes, if you're looking for a specific date, you may notice that the Daily Note for the page doesn't exist.
Here, notes for September 20th-22nd are missing.

Something to know about Daily Notes is that although they are automatically created each day, theyÂ **only save when you use them.**
A Daily Note will save in one of two cases:
1. You write on the page.
2. You linked to the Daily Note from a different page.
You can see this from the All Notes view (from the left sidebar). In the picture below, pages for September 17th and 19th were created but have no content.

Both dates have one mention, though. You can see from the Linked References of the page that the Daily Note of September 17th was linked from the previous day.

If you can't find a specific date in your Roam graph, it is most likely because you didn't use Roam on that day or you did all your writing in separate pages.
