    - "Sometimes, when listening to a technical conversation, I think about my grandmother immersed in gibberish, waiting for a few, precious words to reveal themselves to her. Saying ^^__“I’m not technical”__, while a well-intentioned reflex, prematurely shuts down the upper bound of the conversation.^^ Worse, it signals __“I’m not that kind of person so don’t try to talk to me like I am”__, which can have a dampening effect on the other person, especially if they’re genuinely excited to share something they care about. It’s the conversational equivalent of putting your hands up."
    - "If you don’t know what’s going on, there’s no shame in asking questions. ^^Questions aren’t a sign of ignorance; they’re a sign you’re paying attention.^^ “Technical” people is kind of a nonsensical term, when you think about it. Nobody is literate on every technical topic out there. A chemist has no idea what a cryptographer is talking about (unless they’ve learned both fields, of course!). ^^**I think technical people are just people who try to understand.**^^"
