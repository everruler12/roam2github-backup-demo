    - Going Meta
        - We're used to moving down in bulleted lists
            - but sometimes you want to talk ABOUT a thing
                - and the most logical place for that discussion isn't nested under the thing
        - Try clicking the number at the right of this block to see where I've talked about this elsewhere
        - Related [[Questions]] about [[Roam]]
            - When to create a new page, versus linking to a specific block/bulletpoint
                - Bullet points have a context
                    - So for example if I'm talking about this tree 
                        - Problems with the US Healthcare System
                            - Cost
                            - Poorly Aligned Incentives
                    - and I want to say something like
                        - The "Cost" is really an outcome of "Poorly Aligned Incentives"
                    - It makes more sense to use bullet-mentions than to reference a page for [[Cost]] or [[[Poorly aligned incentives]]], because I'm actually talking about those things **with respect to** their position in the list of "Problems with the US Healthcare System" not as a global phenomenon
                        - This is even more relevant if I'm doing this in the context of notes I'm taking about a particular book -- since then I have the added context of knowing where this idea is coming from.
    - What's the best way to describe "Going Meta"?
        - Its a way of talking __ABOUT__ a bullet point without zooming into it
        - It makes it easier to talk about two or more bullet points that might be in different parts of your tree
            - For example
    - What is even the context in which I'm asking "What's the best way to describe "Going Meta"?"
        - https://twitter.com/KimStacks/status/1161568087738503169
        - Really though, the full context is this
            - https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1161559517454327808
            - Point I'm making is that you want to be able to have a discussion about the things you've written -- in the place, in roughy the same way, as you have other kinds of discussions
                - All about use - mention distinction
    - How does Roam help with "Going Meta"?
        - If you type in `((`between these`))` you can get a mention of other {{or: blocks | paragraphs | bullets}} in your database
        - When you see that block, there is a counter of how many times that block has been mentioned
            - Which is basically -- how many times has someone said something ABOUT this block
    - What could Roam do better to handle the use case of "Going Meta"?
    - Why would you try "Going Meta" using Roam's reference feature, rather than just using regular language?
        - Mostly because of "When you see that block, there is a counter of how many times that block has been mentioned"
            - This means that -- when you're thinking about that thing again, or when someone else is reading it, you can get a lot more context of the full scope of your thinking on the thing by just clicking that little number

    - [[Tiago Forte]] was spouting some nonsense last night

            - Rebuttal is this "The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the [[task]] of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The [[inheritance]] from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected."

            - Probably a lot of habits people can implement using our existing software now
