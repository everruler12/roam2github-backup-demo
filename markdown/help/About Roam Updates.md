- How often do you release updates?
    - We generally release updates as we finish them, so usually we'll deploy changes a few times a week.

    - We do our best to keep the change log up to date, but because [we release very frequently](((PBQARwWkt))), sometimes the change log is a few days behind Conor's twitter updates
